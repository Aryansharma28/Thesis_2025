While some view this as modern protest, there are concerns it could undermine genuine opposition to the FCC's proposals. The FCC has not commented on the issue.",

The best thing to do is to speak early on to your school's IT department or the people who look after the school website.\nYou need to create a dedicated School Report web page on the school website so that people can find the students' work. It has to be accessible to the public, so don't use internal websites (or intranets) or pages that need a password.\nUntil your pupils' reports are ready, the page should contain a \"holding\" or \"come back later\" message. You can copy and paste this:\nStudents from this school will be making the news for real on 16 March 2017 as they take part in BBC News School Report. We aim to publish the news by 1600 GMT on News Day, so please save this page as a favourite and return to it later.\nHave a click through to examples from our School Report map if you want an idea of how other schools have gone about it.\nOnce the page is live, email the web address (URL) to the School Report team via schoolreport@bbc.co.uk so we can link to your webpage.\nAs soon as possible! It saves a lot of hassle in the busy run-up to News Day when you and the School Reporters would probably rather be focusing on getting great interviews than sorting out technical issues.\nAs soon as your page is ready, the School Report team can link to your website from the map of participating schools. - as long as both pieces of School Report paperwork have been returned!\nOnce live, some schools use the page to reflect what's happening in the build-up to the News Day, for example adding team photos and encouraging pupils to post news reporting ideas.\nNo. It is important to create a dedicated web page, so the BBC can link directly to the students' journalistic work. The fewer the clicks, the more likely you are to retain the audience.\nAlso, after the News Day, the homepage of a school website will inevitably change, but creating a dedicated page means there is a permanent record of their work.\nYes. If your school has participated in School Report in previous years, you can use the existing web page, but remember to label it clearly.\nRemember, you risk losing people's attention if they think your web page is out of date. A simple message at the top of the page can be helpful, such as the example mentioned above.\nIf you can't publish School Report content on your school website, all is not lost!\nYou could look at hosting stories on another website that you consider appropriate and that is in line with your school's policy. See if your local council or academy sponsor could help host your content.\nSome schools have used websites such as Makewaves, a website designed to host video and audio material for educational purposes.\nYou could create a web page using a number of different programmes, with many people using software such as Microsoft Expression or Adobe Dreamweaver.\nIf you do use a site other than your school site, check the terms and conditions to make sure it is suitable for 11 to 16-year-olds and that there are no advertisements on the site.\nThe golden rule is to use first names only. For child protection reasons, the BBC cannot link to a page which contains the surnames of anyone younger than 18. This also applies to blog entries and comments posted on the page.\nRefer to the School Report guidelines on staying safe and legal which highlight some of the issues anyone should consider when publishing content which features children. This page also offers guidance about media law issues such as copyright, libel and contempt of court as well as editorial issues such as taste and decency.\nBe aware that the BBC website is very popular. By virtue of a link from the BBC, students will have a large audience but people will also be able to access other pages on the school website.\nAt the bottom of this page, there are some School Report graphics you can use on your dedicated web page. However, they can only be used by schools who have completed their paperwork, and within the context of the project.\nIt is also a good idea to incorporate the design of your school website to create a uniform look.\nIt is best to avoid a design which relies on large pictures as it will make pages slow to download and could put off potential viewers. However, you might like to add photographs of students taking part in School Report or the school logo.\nOur agreement with the head teacher of every school taking part explicitly states that the school, not the BBC, is responsible for the school website. Teachers need to decide on the most suitable way of hosting content according to their school's social media, internet safety and child protection policies.\nFor this reason, we are happy to link to school websites which use YouTube (or similar video-sharing websites) to embed content, provided the school website complies with our guidelines in all other ways. We will not, however, link directly to YouTube.\nSome schools have used websites such as Makewaves, a website designed to host video and audio material for educational purposes.\nProviding the school website complies with our guidelines in all other ways, we are happy to link to school websites containing links to social media.\nGenerally though, we do not recommend including links to social media websites such as Facebook and Twitter from your school website, as they are designed to be used by children aged 13 or over. There is a risk of students experiencing cyberbullying via such sites.\nIf your school website contains an automated Twitter feed, you may want to look into deactivating it or at least monitoring it during the busy time around News Day.\nA dedicated page means the audience can find students' work easily and quickly. It also provides a  permanent archive of students' reports and makes it clear that the reports are new and not from previous years. The page can also help avoid any potential child protection issues.\nRight click the images, and select Save Picture As.",

How we respond will determine the impact on jobs and growth.\n\"We must provide fiscal credibility, continuing to be tough on the deficit while being realistic about achieving a surplus by the end of the decade.\"\nLabour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell welcomed the move, saying: \"Sadly the vote last Thursday for Brexit has only brought forward what was inevitable.\n\"The Chancellor had already dropped his other fiscal rules on welfare and debt at the Budget in March, and according to many economists he was expected to be forced to drop this one too.\"\nBBC business editor Kamal Ahmed says that the target was heading for the \"Treasury shredding machine\" following a speech from Home Secretary Theresa May yesterday.\nIn a speech launching her bid to become prime minister she said \"we should no longer seek to reach a budget surplus by the end of the parliament\".\nKamal says that Mr Osborne has now followed suit.\nNevertheless, the Treasury insists that it still wants to balance the books and \"fix the finances\".\nMr Osborne first committed himself to returning the national finances to surplus by 2020 at the Conservative Party conference in 2013 and it became policy in the July budget of 2015.\nBut there have been questions ever since over whether that target could be met.\nEven before the referendum vote he only had \"a slightly better than 50/50 chance\" of making the target said Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.\nBut the uncertainty caused by the Leave vote could hold back the economy and make creating a surplus even more difficult.\n\"Having voted for Brexit last week, the economy is clearly going to go into a downswing, that might be a full-blown recession, that might just be very very low growth,\" said Paul Johnson the director of the IFS.\nIt is sometimes easy in these incredible political times to forget that for most people \"it's the economy, stupid\" still holds true.\nFor the UK economy, one of the most important passages of Theresa May's speech yesterday was when she signalled that George Osborne's \"fiscal rule\" (to produce a budget surplus by 2020) was for the Treasury shredding machine.\n\"While it is absolutely vital that the government continues with its intention to reduce public spending and cut the budget deficit, we should no longer seek to reach a budget surplus by the end of the parliament,\" Mrs May said.\nNow the chancellor has said he agrees, arguing that the government must be \"realistic\" about its fiscal targets and that austerity policies could be eased.\nMy Treasury sources point out that the \"rule\" can be varied in \"non-normal\" times.\nAnd these are pretty \"non-normal\" times.\nThe abandonment of the fiscal target suggests the government could borrow more, presumably for investment in infrastructure and to mitigate the need for tax rises and spending cuts, if the economy does take a turn for the worse as some predict.\nMore from Kamal: Brexit and the easing of austerity\nThe Tories have been in turmoil since David Cameron announced his intention to resign following the UK's vote in favour on leaving the European Union.\nIn a shock development on Thursday, Boris Johnson, widely seen as the frontrunner to become prime minister, announced that he would not be running.\nThe BBC has learned that Justice Secretary Michael Gove is now coming under growing pressure to abandon his bid to become Tory leader.\nSources have told the BBC government ministers are trying to persuade the justice secretary to give way so the party can \"unite\" around Home Secretary Theresa May.\nMr Gove opted to stand after switching his support from Boris Johnson.\nIn a speech, Mr Gove said his decision to stand to become Conservative leader is driven by \"conviction\" about what is right for the UK not personal ambition.\nThree other candidates have put their names forward for the Conservative leadership: Energy Minister Andrea Leadsom, MP Liam Fox and Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb.\nThe government borrowed Â£74.9bn in the 2015/2016 fiscal year and for the financial year so far - covering April and May - borrowing reached Â£17.9bn, Â£0.2bn higher than the same period a year ago.\nIt is thought that the government will now raise borrowing, so it can avoid further cuts in spending or raising taxes. It could also borrow to invest in big building projects.\n\"The problem of course is, you can't borrow forever,\"said Paul Johnson from the IFS.\n\"So we'll have a few more years of more borrowing, but my guess is this is not the end of austerity, actually this means austerity will just go on for longer because we'll probably have the spending cuts and tax rises right through the 2020s to pay for this.\"",

This shift indicates potential increased borrowing to invest in infrastructure and mitigate tax rises and spending cuts if the economy worsens. The political landscape is also in flux, with Theresa May emerging as a unifying candidate for Conservative leadership amid post-Brexit turmoil. The government borrowed £74.9bn in 2015/2016, and further borrowing is anticipated to avoid immediate austerity, though it may extend austerity into the 2020s.",

    "generated": "The Irish government upgraded its growth forecast for 2014 to around 4.5%, marking a significant economic recovery after a recession. This growth, the strongest since the early 2000s, contrasts sharply with the eurozone's 0.7% growth. The improved economy, following years of austerity and a bailout, will reduce Ireland's budget deficit to about 3.5% of GDP, eliminating the need for planned tax hikes and spending cuts. The recovery is driven by increased consumption and construction, indicating a domestic recovery, though less intense than headline figures suggest.",

US media report that unusually, his high school yearbook of 2010 contained no photograph of him.\n\"Camera shy\" was the comment by his entry.\nUnlike the majority of his peers, Lanza apparently had no Facebook page. His online footprint was minimal. He appears not to have been known to the police.\nAdam Lanza lived with his mother in a well-to-do neighbourhood of Newtown, Connecticut. The house is about five miles (8km) from Sandy Hook School, which he attended as a child.\nHe went on to Newtown High School, but made few friends. His mother pulled him out of the school and taught him at home because she was unhappy with the school district's plan for his education.\nHis aunt, Marsha Lanza, said that Adam was \"definitely the challenge to the family in that house\".\n\"Every family has one. I have one. They have one. â€¦ But he was a very bright boy, he was smart,\" she said.\nIntelligent but shy and nervous were the most common memories of those who learnt beside him.\nRichard Novia, who was head of security at Newtown High School, said it was clear Lanza had \"some disabilities\".\nHe was protective of his personal space and sometimes appeared to completely withdraw into himself or to \"take flight\", Mr Novia told AP, meaning his mother had to be called in to resolve the problem.\n\"You had yourself a very scared young boy, who was very nervous around people he could trust or he refused to speak with.\"\nMr Novia helped to run a technology club, which Lanza attended, and said he had to keep a close eye on him while the club was using soldering equipment or electrical equipment.\n\"If that boy would've burned himself, he would not have known it or felt it physically,\" he said.\nAn inability to respond to sensation, and a difficult in relating to other people, could be an indication of Asperger's Syndrome (a form of autism), say experts.\nThey stress there is no direct link between the condition and aggression. People with the condition can sometimes struggle to express themselves in socially expected ways, however.\nOlivia DeVivo was a student with Lanza in the 10th grade, at about the age of 15. She told the Associated Press he was \"very shy and didn't make an effort to interact with anybody\".\n\"Now looking back, it's kind of like 'OK, he had all these signs,' but you can't say every shy person would do something like this,\" she said.\nA former school bus driver in the town, Marsha Moskowitz, said she remembered the Lanza boys.\n\"You know the trouble kids, and you figure, 'Pfft, that one's going to be trouble.' But I never would have thought that about them,\" she told the Hartford Courant newspaper.\nMarsha Lanza told the Associated Press that Adam had been raised by kind, nurturing parents, who would not have hesitated to seek counselling for their son if he needed it.\nThe parents divorced in 2009, having separated at least three years earlier. His father, Peter Lanza, moved to Stamford, Connecticut, and recently remarried.\nHis mother, Nancy, remained in the family home, where it is thought she was killed by her son. She had previously worked in finance, but her divorce settlement left her well off and she stayed at home.\nFriends said she was popular and sociable. An acquaintance, Jim Leff, wrote on his blog that she was \"a friend-of-friends who I periodically would briefly bump into, and who always seemed kind-hearted... and, yes, a bit high-strung. But with ample reason, as it turns out.\"\nContrary to initial reports, Nancy Lanza never worked as a teacher at Sandy Hook Elementary School.\nShe was a gun enthusiast who is reported to have taken her sons with her to the shooting range. Adam Lanza used her legally purchased Bushmaster assault rifle to carry out his attack. He was also carrying his mother's two handguns, a Glock pistol and a Sig Sauer. Police found a shotgun in his car.\nAdam Lanza's elder brother, 24-year-old Ryan, who was initially named in the media as the suspected gunman, has been helping police with their investigation. US media is reporting that he told them he had had no contact with his brother since 2010.\nIn a statement issued to the media, Lanza's father said: \"No words can truly express how heartbroken we are.\n\"We, too, are asking why. Like so many of you, we are saddened and struggling to make sense of what has transpired.\"",

His mother, a gun enthusiast, was reportedly killed by Lanza before he used her legally purchased firearms to carry out a tragic attack.

The Conference bent over backwards to help them.\n\"I described the news of the board's offer of an extension on Friday evening as not so much 'last chance saloon', but rather 'last orders in last chance saloon' and United have seemingly chosen not to offer the league the assurances they were seeking.\n\"It is a desperately sad day for all Hereford supporters, but the Bulls have nobody to blame but themselves.\n\"You have to feel very sorry for those players who gave their all at Aldershot on the last day of the season to keep Hereford in the Conference Premier.

    "source": "His grandmother offered him a plate of grapes, but she doesn't remember whether Faizan had it. The son of a farmer then put on his pheran, the woollen cape-like garment Kashmiris wear, and quietly left for his Sunday lessons.\nA few hours later, Faizan lay dead near a sun-baked school playground, ringed by bare walnut and willow trees. Paramilitary soldiers, eyewitnesses alleged, had shot him in the back of his head.\nCarrying a packet of biscuits, he was returning home on a bright, nippy morning when he encountered a throng of local people protesting against Indian rule near the school, where polling was taking place for a parliamentary by-election.\nEyewitnesses say four shots rang out of the single-storey, squat school building which, according to some reports, was being pelted with stones thrown by protesters from a hill above and from the road in front.\nFaizan possibly halted to find out what the commotion was all about, and was hit by a bullet. Two neighbours ran up to his home to deliver the news. His mother had sprinted down to the playground, hugged her bleeding son and let others take him to hospital.\n\"I knew he was gone,\" Zarifa told me.\nA heart-wrenching video recorded by a villager on his mobile phone minutes after the killing shows a wailing man cradling the dead boy, blood streaming down his broken face, in a packed vehicle taking him to the nearest hospital. There, the doctors declared him dead.\nFaizan's final journey is recorded on another mobile phone video: his slight frame, draped in white, bobbing slightly on a hospital cot, carried through a sea of weeping, agitated mourners extolling their latest \"martyr\". By late afternoon, his body was lowered into the grave near his village, Dalwan.\nFaizan was among the eight people killed on Sunday when paramilitary soldiers fired bullets and shotgun pellets at those protesting against Indian rule at polling centres near Srinagar, the summer capital. Election authorities say some 170 people, including 100 security personnel, were injured in about 200 incidents of stone pelting and violent protests on the day.\nThe voter turnout in Sunday's election was an abysmal 7.1% - the lowest in decades - and came as a huge setback for the region's mainstream parties.\nThe soldiers had been brought in from other states to secure polling stations and may have been unprepared to deal with \"protests and provocation\" in a complex conflict zone like Kashmir, a senior official told me.\nOne report said the police had registered complaints against the paramilitary forces for firing into the crowds.\nSeparatist groups had rejected the elections and urged voters to boycott Sunday's poll, which took place after a politician resigned over what he described as the \"anti-people\" agenda of the Indian government.\nDisillusioned voters - even in relatively peaceful places like Dalwan where people turned out to cast their votes enthusiastically in previous elections - generally stayed away.\nWhy Faizan was killed on a day when local voters rejected the ballot is not clear.\nBy all accounts, he was not pelting stones or hurling abuse at the soldiers. One report said police fired tear gas shells to keep the protesters away from the empty polling station, but the soldiers opened fire.\nWhatever it is, Faizan became another grisly statistic in Kashmir's unending tragedy.\nA picture taken by his friend on his mobile phone during their winter break shows the shy-looking boy - \"he would often top his class, and he was very knowledgeable about the world,\" the friend said - clad in a woollen cap and collared jacket, peering uneasily into the camera.\n\"He was quiet and studious, he was doing well in school. He played cricket, and counted [former Indian captain] MS Dhoni as his favourite cricketer. He wanted to become a doctor,\" a cousin told me, when I visited the family.\nGrief is the price one pays for love. Zarifa's lament for her dead son filled the still air inside a tent outside their home where local women had gathered to mourn.\n\"My son, my son, where will I find you now?\" she cried, again and again.\nThen she stepped out of the tent, entered her home and joined her husband in a dank, cold room. He sat there, stoic and numb, surrounded by mourners, and gazed vacantly at the pastel pink walls. The room had a red carpet and red window curtains.\n\"The blood of a martyr never goes waste,\" said Fayaz Ahmad Dar. \"One day, the blood of innocents will help us gain our freedom [from Indian rule].\"\nA brief silence followed. Zarifa broke it, bemoaning the loss of her boy.\n\"I am looking at your books, I am looking at your school bags. How will I touch your books again, my son? Everybody would talk about your intelligence, how you would answer every question with so much wit.\"\nOutside the secondary school - Enter to learn, Leave to serve, its motto, is engraved on the walls - a group of young men gathered later in the day. Their eyes seethed in anger. They spoke about frustration, alienation, desperation, humiliation and hopelessness.\nThey said they had lost their fear of life. They insisted that they helped rebels because \"they are our brothers and don't kill civilians\" and are \"fighting for freedom\".\nMore than half of them raised their hands when asked whether they had pelted stones at Indian forces.\n\"We are not safe in our own homes, we are not safe on streets. They are killing little boys now. Life is uncertain,\" said Feroze Ali, a school clerk.\nSince February alone, some two dozen civilians have been killed during gunfights between armed rebels and security forces. The security forces have accused civilians of helping rebels escape.\nThe army says it has tried to reach out and engage with civilians through its 29 schools, youth clubs and cricket tournaments.\nRecently some 19,000 Kashmiri young men applied for a few hundred vacancies in the army.\n\"Provocation and panic can lead to accidents. Security forces often fire when they face life threatening situations. But protecting civilians remains our first priority in this situation. When a civilian dies, it hurts us,\" an army officer told me.\nThe region has seen heightened tension and increased unrest since July when influential militant Burhan Wani was killed by Indian forces. More than 100 civilians lost their lives in clashes with protesters during a four-month-long lockdown, including a 55-day-curfew, in the restive Muslim-majority valley.\nKashmir, clearly, appears to be teetering on the brink of an open public revolt against Indian rule.\nMany say the federal government's near-complete lack of engagement and dialogue with local stakeholders and Pakistan, a complete mistrust of the local government and a lack of development and jobs have left most people jittery and alienated.\nMilitancy continues to be at low ebb - there are an estimated 250 militants in the state now of which 150 are local - compared to several thousand during the peak of insurgency in the 1990s.\nBut young Kashmiris - more than 60% of the men in the valley are under 30, and more than 40% of men in Kashmir are jobless - are restless and angry. The local political parties are in danger of \"becoming irrelevant\", as a leader of an opposition party told me.\n\"This is the worst situation that I have seen. Earlier, it was a movement led by the militants. Now it is being led by the people,\" says Feroze Ali, 35, a schoolteacher.\n\"India needs to be worried, very worried about this.\"",

Immediately after the UK leaders debates, George Osborne was talking up the performance of Nicola Sturgeon.\n\"I am not sure what kind of bizarre tactical game he was playing but it can only have helped the SNP increase their support further.\n\"And now the Conservatives in Scotland are getting in the way of our battles to stop the SNP in the 11 Westminster seats we hold in Scotland.\"\nWhat are the top issues for each political party at the 2015 general election?\nPolicy guide: Where the parties stand\nMs Sturgeon attacked both the Tories and Labour as she continued election campaigning.\nShe said: \"People in Scotland have always known to expect harsh, ideological cuts from the Tories - and today's cuts manifesto is likely to be more of the same. But that Labour have been so quick to meekly fall into line with George Osborne's plans just goes to show how far they have moved away from their roots.\n\"And with Ed Balls lifting the lid on Labour's cuts plans yesterday and finally putting an end to Jim Murphy's anti-cuts pretence, Labour's commitment to austerity is clear for all to see.\"\nThe SNP leader and first minister of Scotland had earlier taken questions from listeners on BBC Radio's Five Live morning phone in.\nIn response to a question from presenter Nicky Campbell, Ms Sturgeon reiterated that she was not planning another independence referendum. She said that if you voted SNP on 7 May, you were not voting for another referendum.\nIn Cumbernauld, Mr Murphy said SNP plans for Scottish taxes supporting Scotland's finances would mean millions lost for working families in tax credits.\nMr Murphy said: \"The SNP's reckless plans will cost working families the most, with a £7.6bn black hole in Scotland's finances and the end of the UK welfare state as we know it.\n\"Scotland doesn't have to choose between Tory austerity or SNP austerity max. Scottish Labour is the only party on the ballot paper offering a real alternative to austerity.\n\"Only Labour is big enough and strong enough to kick the Tories out and give working families the support they need.\"\nMeanwhile, the Scottish Greens backed the manifesto commitments of the Green Party of England and Wales which they believe would make a positive difference to people's lives.\nAlison Johnstone, from the Scottish Greens said: \"Greens across these islands are clear: we must end Westminster's failed austerity experiment.\"\nVoters throughout the UK go to the polls on 7 May to choose their next MP.\nPolling suggests the contest will be tight and no one party will win an overall majority in the House of Commons.",

The large scales are attached only by a relatively narrow region that tears with ease.\nIn addition, beneath the scales there is a pre-formed splitting zone within the skin itself.\nAlthough several other geckos are able to lose their skin like this if they are grasped firmly, fish-scale geckos are able to do so actively - and at the slightest touch.\nThey can also grow them back scar-free in a matter of weeks, while other geckos might take a long time to regenerate their scales.\nBut Geckolepis megalepis is remarkable for the huge size of its scales. The researchers hypothesise that larger scales tear more easily than smaller ones, because of their greater surface area relative to the attachment area, and larger friction surface.\n\"What's really remarkable though is that these scales - which are really dense and may even be bony, and must be quite energetically costly to produce - and the skin beneath them tear away with such ease, and can be regenerated quickly and without a scar,\" said lead author Mark Scherz, from the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.\nThe new species was discovered in the Tsingy cave formations of northern Madagascar.",

    "source": "When Google paid $3.2bn (Â£2.1bn) to buy Tony Fadell's start-up Nest in 2014, it got much more than just an internet-connected thermostat and smoke detector.\nIt got the man dubbed the \"the iPod's father\" - the engineer/designer who sold Steve Jobs on his vision of a portable music player, and then worked alongside Jony Ive to build it, update it and then repeat the process with the iPhone.\nNow, the two men are set to go head-to-head. First with wearable tech, and then later, perhaps, with competing car designs - more of which later.\nTellingly, Mr Fadell reveals he recently started testing Sir Jonathan's latest product, the Apple Watch, although he was not wearing it at the time of interview.\n\"I've had mine for about two weeks now,\" he says.\n\"I think they did a tremendous job on the hardware components of it.\n\"They are trying many different things with that platform - some are going to be great, and some are not.\"\nWhen Mr Fadell agreed to sell Nest to Google, the reason he gave was that joining forces would accelerate his \"thoughtful home\" master plan - he hates the term \"internet of things\", which he says does a \"disservice\" to his products.\nBut in January, it became clear that Google's chief executive, Larry Page, had wider uses for his hardware expertise, and the troubled Glass computer was added to his duties.\n\"It wasn't handed to me and said, 'Tony clean it up,'\" Mr Fadell clarifies, \"I offered.\"\n\"I remember what it was like when we did the iPod and the iPhone. I think this can be that important, but it's going to take time to get it right.\"\nThe $1,500 (Â£965) \"explorer edition\" of Glass was soon pulled from sale, and Mr Fadell made clear that future test versions would be kept in-house.\nThat was widely seen as a shift in strategy for Google - a company that took five years to take its Gmail service out of \"beta\" status, and that still invites users to \"play\" with preview versions of other products.\nMoreover, it caused anger among developers who had sunk time and money into making apps for a product that no longer existed.\nBut Mr Fadell defends the shift, saying a distinction needed to be drawn between hardware and software.\n\"If you are only doing services based on electrons, you can iterate quickly, test it, and modify it and get it right,\" he says.\n\"But when you are dealing with actual atoms - hardware - and you have to get manufacturing lines and it takes a year or more to develop that product, you better understand what it is and what it's trying to do and specifically what it's not going to do.\n\"Customers have to spend money to buy those atoms.\n\"They want something that delivers value or you end up with a real disappointment and you can spoil the market.\"\nFor now, that leaves Mr Fadell's reputation dependent on his Nest line-up.\nIt is limited to three products, including the recently launched Nest Cam.\nThe motion-detecting camera streams live footage and sound from the owner's home to an app and can save memorable moments in the cloud.\nIf you get over the creepiness factor of effectively spying on your family, it's fair to say the device shares the crisp, stylish look of the Nest's other products, and reviews have been positive.\nBut the camera is actually an upgrade to an earlier device made by Dropcam - a company Nest acquired.\nThat means Mr Fadell's division has not created a new product category of its own since joining Google.\nBearing in mind, Mr Page told him to \"keep doing what you're doing, and do it as fast as you possibly can\", it raises the question: what's taking so long?\n\"Talk to me about the number of home product companies who have come out with three different product categories in less than five years... are shipping and they are the number ones in their category,\" says Mr Fadell, slightly bristling.\n\"I would love to have more, faster.\n\"But it takes time - it really takes time to make these products to the level of design and near-perfection that we achieve.\"\nHe adds that Nest's biggest goal right now is to expand the range of third-party products its devices talk to - for example its Thermostats can switch LG fridges into energy-saving mode when no-one's in, and its Protect sensors can make Philip's Hue lights flash red if they detect smoke or carbon monoxide.\nBut such advances have less impact than a new product.\n\"Despite his substantial success to date and involvement in key products such as Apple iPod, Mr Fadell has arguably not yet reached the truly iconic status bestowed upon Jonathan Ive,\" Ben Wood, from the tech consultancy CCS Insight, says.\n\"Given the huge amount Google invested in the acquisition of Nest to secure his services there must be an expectation that he too can deliver his own portfolio of truly disruptive devices with mass appeal.\n\"Google still lacks a smash-hit consumer electronics device of its own - it would be sensible to assume it hopes Mr Fadell can deliver that missing element.\"\nThe two men worked together on first iPods and iPhones, but are credited with different achievements.\nWith the iPod, Mr Fadell first convinced Steve Jobs of the wisdom of developing a portable music player and then worked out how to incorporate a hard drive - a fragile component - into a device that could be thrown about, sat on and generally abused.\nJony Ive's breakthrough was his design of its thumb-wheel, which scrolled through songs more rapidly as it was spun more quickly.\nWith the iPhone, perhaps Mr Fadell's greatest feat was finding a way to shrink the tech necessary to offer a multi-touch user interface on a handheld device.\nJony Ive's skill was best summed up by one writer as making the final product look almost more like \"a piece of jewellery than a gadget\".\nIn post-Jobs Apple, Sir Jonathan's influence has grown further - extending to the look of the company's operating system software, the creation of its Watch and even the design of its new headquarters.\nBy contrast, Mr Fadell has thrived beyond - building and selling a multi-billion dollar company, reinventing mundane household devices as desirable gadgets, and becoming one of Google's key figures.\nThis leads to thoughts about whether Mr Fadell could become involved in other Google projects.\nA question about working on its growing roster of robots is rebuffed on the grounds that they are still a long way from leaving the lab.\nBut self-driving cars, he adds, are much closer to launch and a \"big curiosity\".\n\"I don't think you've seen anything of what the design of the car could look like when it first materialises,\" he says.\n\"How do you make those occupants feel like they are safe and make sure they are safe?\n\"How does the car exude safety [and be] fashionable as well?\n\"How does this 'utility' self-driving car also be a reflection of you, right, as well as itself and also be transparent about its safety?\n\"Those are very interesting questions that still need to be dealt with.\"\nHe adds that he has \"some thoughts\" about the answers and is sharing them with others involved in Google's self-driving car project.\n\"We are having discussion about them all the time,\" he says.\n\"I always have ideas - it's whether or not people want to hear them.\"\nSo, nothing official yet.\nBut it would not be a surprise if Google eventually announces Mr Fadell is adding automobile design to his list of duties.\nAnd if, as rumoured, Sir Jonathan and his team are also working on their own electric car concept, that could set up a fascinating clash between the two former colleagues in the future.",

Let's play budget bingo.\n\"Osborne's austerity is wrong for Scotland\": There will be a squeeze of more than 5% (the Scottish government prefers a slightly different calculation rounding it up to 6%) in current or revenue (non-capital) spending.\n\"Difficult decisions have to be made\": If the health service is protected from cuts, and schools too, departments with less than half the budget have to absorb all the cuts.\nThat is likely to feature local government, which has been told to brace itself for some deep cuts in grant funding over the next five years.\nJohn Swinney could sweeten the pill by allowing them to raise council tax - as George Osborne did south of the border, allowing a 2% council tax rise if it is to pay for social care.\nBut it will be tempting to stick to a ninth year of freezing council tax, even though that will cost him a cumulated Â£630m out of next year's budget, and even though it is more generous to those with the biggest bills.\n\"Taxes for a fairer Scotland\": That'll be the reason for not using the new Scottish Rate of Income Tax. Both Mr Swinney and the first minister have said they want to use income tax powers only when they are sufficiently flexible to tilt the burden towards those most able to pay it.\nThat will probably, eventually, mean a rise in higher rate tax, or changes to thresholds. That flexibility won't be added to this year's new powers until 2017.\n\"A healthy private rented housing market\": Mr Swinney could choose to follow Mr Osborne's example last month, by raising property transaction tax on buy-to-let homes. It would be a progressive move.\nBut the Scottish finance secretary doesn't need to burst a house price bubble in and around his capital city. He may also want to give landlords something they like, to make up for the boost to tenants' rights they are soon to face.\n\"ESA10\": Technical jargon for public finance nerds, but it matters a lot. Mr Swinney has to give more detail than he did last month on the constraints placed on capital projects by a European accounting rule that makes significant capital projects a public liability rather than the private one that had been planned.\n\"Scottish Fiscal Commission\": This independent, new-ish body will publish its reckoning of Mr Swinney's fiscal projections at the same time his draft budget is delivered. Watch for a shortfall in revenue from Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (the successor to Stamp Duty).\n\"The A9\": The road is busy, it's being dualled, slowly, and it runs right through Mr Swinney's constituency.\n\"PFI on steroids\": Labour's Jackie Baillie will complain about the \"debt mountain\" being built up under the SNP. Quoting a report from The Guardian about Â£15bn of council debt and the liabilities resulting from the Public Finance Initiative and its successors, she probably won't explain that a lot of it was built up while she was a minister.\n\"Capitulation to the powerful roads lobby\": Greens will complain that insufficient money has been directed towards household energy efficiency, and too much is going on building a new Forth crossing and Aberdeen ring road.\n\"Eye off the ball\": Conservatives will blame any and all shortcomings in public sector performance and economic performance on the SNP government's campaign for independence. It's a way of rallying 'No' voters. Watch Ruth Davidson for pointers towards manifesto tax cut pledges.\n\"Budget for fairness, for growth and for Scotland\": Whatever is announced, and whatever the reality, Mr Swinney will present his draft budget as all these and more.\n\"House!\" (Yes, more housing too. It will be a theme of the SNP election campaign.)",

Swinney faces constraints from European accounting rules on capital projects and scrutiny from the Scottish Fiscal Commission. The budget will address issues like local government funding cuts, housing, and infrastructure projects, while political opponents critique various aspects, including debt and spending priorities.

One Western diplomat said he had been told recently by a Free Syrian Army commander that it was not possible to get any ammunition or other supplies in. Cut off from help, it was only a matter of time, perhaps, for the rebels.\nThere are other parts of Homs still, just, in rebel hands. But if they, along with Khalidiya, do fall, Homs will become just the latest in a line of regime victories on the battlefield.\nThe regime's forces have been steadily picking off some of the villages around Homs. Two months ago, with the help of Hezbollah, they recaptured the town of Qusair. The government has halted - if not quite turned around - a rebel advance on Damascus. Sources close to the regime say an offensive is also planned for the northern city of Aleppo.\nAfter Khalidiya, Syria conflict goes on\nIn pictures: Khalidiya devastation\nOn Monday, an unnamed army officer told Syrian state television: \"Today, we can report having complete control of the area of Khalidiya.\"\n\"That was a victory of all our fighters and the whole Syrian Army and especially our dear leader, Bashar al-Assad. And God willing, we will get rid of the terrorists in the entire country and the future will be free of killings and under the control of the army.\"\nHowever, UK-based activist group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights cast doubt on the claim.\nWhile the group acknowledged that government forces were in control of most of Khalidiya, it said fighting was continuing on Monday.\n\"Clashes took place between rebels and regime forces, supported by Hezbollah and National Defence Forces, in the southern parts of the Khalidiya neighbourhood,\" it said.\n\"Regime forces are bombarding parts, and military reinforcements are arriving as advancing regime forces try to establish full control.\"\nOpposition activists told the AFP news agency that about 90% of Khalidiya was now controlled by the army. One told the Associated Press that the battle for the district was \"almost over\".\nOn Sunday, the Arabic TV station al-Mayadeen, which is seen as close to the Syrian government, broadcast what it said was footage of Khalidiya, showing heavily damaged buildings and piles of rubble.\nIt also showed pictures of the interior of the historic Khaled bin Walid mosque, a focal point for anti-government protesters. Troops reportedly seized it on Saturday, days after activists accused them of firing shells at the tomb of Khaled bin Walid, a revered figure in Islam.\nOnly the Old City of Homs and a few other districts are still held by the opposition. On Monday, government jets bombed the Bab Hud district of the Old City, just south of Khalidiya, according to the Syrian Observatory.",

While the Syrian government claims complete control of Khalidiya, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reports ongoing clashes in the area. The fall of Khalidiya marks another regime victory, following the recapture of Qusair, and signals continued efforts to regain rebel-held areas, with plans for an offensive in Aleppo. Despite government claims, opposition activists report that only 90% of Khalidiya is under army control, with fighting persisting in some parts. The conflict in Syria continues, with government forces targeting remaining opposition-held areas in Homs.",

The police watchdog has begun an investigation.\nA statement by her mother, Sharon Grice, read out in court by counsel, said: \"We firmly believe her murder could have been avoided if her fears had been taken seriously by police.\n\"Michael Lane had been harassing, stalking and pressurising her for over a year. Her life became a nightmare which we believe had affected her mental and physical health.\n\"The brutal death of our daughter has ruined our lives forever.

He put a tracker on her car and followed her movements.\n\"That obsession with her translated into killing her. He would not allow anyone else to be with her.\"\nTwo days before Miss Grice was killed, she met Lane at a hotel in Hove to insist their relationship was over, but Lane claimed they had sex earlier that day.\nThe evening before he killed her, he filled a red petrol can with fuel, but claimed he bought it to kill himself due to depression following his grandfather's death.\nThe car mechanic waited until she was alone at the bungalow she shared with two housemates before cutting her throat and trying to set fire to her room.\nProsecutors said one fire was started on the bed and another on the carpet, and Lane dismantled the smoke alarm in the hallway.\nAfter the killing, Lane withdrew Â£60 from Miss Grice's bank account and went to check a lottery ticket before he went to work at SE Tyres in Burgess Hill, where he was arrested.\nHe is due to be sentenced on Thursday.\nMr Justice Green warned Lane he faces a life sentence with a \"very substantial minimum term\".\nDuring the trial, the the court heard Miss Grice complained about her ex-boyfriend to police several times.\nThe Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is conducting an investigation into the contact between Miss Grice, Mr Lane and Sussex Police in the lead-up to her death.\nMr O'Reilly said: \"Within days of her murder I personally visited Shana's family to apologise on behalf of Sussex Police and we made a referral to the IPCC.\n\"We have thoroughly reviewed all aspects of how we deal with cases of stalking and harassment and we have now taken on the learning and our approach is more robust.\"\nAn IPCC spokesman said investigators had already interviewed a number of witnesses and further interviews would be carried out now the trial had finished.",

The Lionesses last lost a competitive qualifier in November 2002.\nEngland had already qualified for next summer's tournament in the Netherlands thanks to the 5-0 thumping of Estonia on 15 September, but England boss Mark Sampson said before the match in Leuven that he was determined his team would end the qualifiers as group leaders.\nBelgium, the only team to have taken a point off Sampson's side during the campaign, could have finished top of Group 7 had they beaten England, but they never truly came close and must settle for second spot.\nNeither team impressed in a first half full of stray passes and pedestrian attacks. England's best chance fell to Lucy Bronze, whose long-range effort was a fraction wide from the top corner.\nBelgium also had an opportunity to break the deadlock and would probably have scored through a Tessa Wullaert in-swinging corner had Jill Scott not headed the danger away.\nBelgium were organised in defence and for most of the match were quick to close down playmaker Karen Carney whenever she received the ball, reducing her influence in the final third and consequently nullifying England.\nBut on the rare occasions Belgium did give Carney space to pull England's strings, the Chelsea forward was ruthless. First, she floated a lovely cross towards the industrious Parris to score her third international goal and followed up with five minutes remaining with a strike which completely wrong-footed Justien Odeurs thanks to the deflection.\nSampson has proved he is not afraid to make changes - tweaking the formation during this campaign and making two changes to the team which beat Estonia, with Siobhan Chamberlain and Gemma Davison replaced by Karen Bardsley and Gilly Flaherty.\nBut it was the introduction of Moore that changed the course of this match, with the midfielder breaking up play and giving the visitors more ballast in midfield.\nEngland's Euro 2017 preparations begin in earnest with a friendly against France, a team ranked third in the world, next month in Doncaster.",

The NEC deny this is the fault of the UKIP system.\n\"Furthermore, highly confidential information about me held in party documents has been leaked to the press and the NEC has not sought to investigate this gross breach of privacy,\" he added.\nMr McGough - who has resigned from the NEC - said Mr Woolfe's exclusion from the contest was \"unfair\" and called into the question the party's future.\nUnless the party elected a \"competent leader who was comfortable with the media, it was finished\", he told World at One. \"This is a fight for survival. It is life or death.\"\nBBC political correspondent Tom Bateman said the NEC's decision \"opens up a whole new schism in UKIP\" and he understood that Mr Farage could call an emergency meeting of the party membership to put pressure on the body to reconsider.\nMr Oakden, who only took over as party chairman this week, said the party was perfectly entitled to call an EGM if 25% of its branches backed the move but said talk of a potential split was over-exaggerated and the remaining contenders were a diverse and exciting group.\nMEP Ms James - now regarded as the favourite in the contest - has launched her own campaign website while Mr Arnott, an MEP for the north east of England, has said he was won the backing of the party's deputy leader Paul Nuttall.\nOf the other candidates, Mr Etheridge is also a member of European Parliament while Lisa Duffy is a councillor in Cambridgeshire.

    "source": "The initial plan was to pass ownership to supporters' group Well Society in five years, but instead it has taken 14 months for the handover to be agreed.\nThis was always going to be the final outcome, since Hutchison was never interested in owning or running the club long-term.\nFor him, a Lanarkshire boy whose business career took him abroad and eventually into a life of significant wealth, the point was to contribute to his local community.\nChallenges remain, though, even if Hutchison believes much of the hard work has been carried out.\nThe significant progress is that costs have been cut, that investments have been made on infrastructure projects at Fir Park and on improving the chances of the football side of the business contributing to self-sustainability.\nHutchison is satisfied that in agreeing to sell his 76% shareholding for £1 to the Well Society, he has paved the way for stability and fan ownership.\nIf there is a message from Hutchison, it is that fans and local businesses need to step up to support the club financially, so that it never needs to be reliant on wealthy individuals or investors.\n\"I can't speak to the future of any business, whether it's secure or otherwise, but if they have enough customers and they follow the strategy which has been implemented, we've significantly improved the probability of success,\" Hutchison told BBC Scotland from his home in Barbados.\n\"[The club] is extremely close [to break even]. In recent months, the player budget has been reduced dramatically, we've been able to sign some really excellent younger players on longer-term contracts, which reduces costs because you don't have to buy a much more experienced player, we've significantly reduced the medical bills by the introduction of the sports scientist.\n\"We could do with a little bit of a boost on the commercial side, but we have that pipeline of young talent coming through which would give the opportunity for additional transfer income.\n\"What [supporters] need to do is decide whether or not they want to try to make it work and whether they want to step up.\n\"The second, and probably more important one, is that I'd like to see more local companies participate more effectively with the club and the community.\"\nHutchison had to address costs at Fir Park since the club was running at a loss.\nBefore John Boyle's controlling interest was transferred in January 2015, Hutchison had to provide £30,000 to pay bills. He has since invested £650,000 and £380,000 in loans, with at least £180,000 having been paid back, and the remaining repayment terms altered.\nMotherwell previously used to budget to finish in the top half of the Premiership, which meant that any drop in form had a significant impact on working capital.\nThat has changed, while 10 players left the club in January, although one of them - James McFadden - subsequently signed a new short-term deal until the end of the season.\nUnder Mark McGhee's management, the focus is to be on developing young players, and Hutchison is particularly proud that under his tenure, Motherwell have reached the youth cup final for the first time in 30 years.\nThe challenge, though, is financial as well as sporting. The income streams of football clubs rise and fall over the course of a season, but there is now no wealthy individual on hand to cover any shortfalls that might arise.\nThe Well Society's membership has plateaued, with some letting their subscriptions slide. The Society needs all of its members to be contributing and for more to join if money is to be raised to support the fan-ownership model.\n\"People got into a bit of a comfort zone that maybe they don't have to participate, 'it's okay, Les is here, don't worry about it',\" Hutchison said.\n\"From the very outset, I wasn't in the business of wanting to own or run a football club in Scotland, I am a philanthropist and I was trying to help the community.\n\"The Society have had up to 1700 people who have at some point in time contributed. All it takes is for people who have done it in the past to do it again and a few more, with also the support of local business who really want to support their local communities and customers, they need to step up a bit more as well.\n\"If that happens, then the thing will be in good hands.\n\"What [the club] has to do is manage the cash flow. That's the challenge. The cash comes in in peaks and troughs because of the way the league does their financing and the way that sponsors pay their money, and TV and so on.\n\"If they could build up some reasonable reserves, they can then manage through the peaks and troughs.\n\"We've been budgeting quite prudently. We've had to take actions to make sure those budgets can be achieved. It all bodes well at this point.\"\nHutchison has stabilised Motherwell - at a personal cost of £1m - and has now left the supporters with the opportunity, and the challenge, of taking over. For that to happen, the Well Society will need to succeed in a way that it hasn't been able to achieve in the past.",

He invested significantly to stabilize the club, cutting costs, investing in infrastructure, and focusing on youth development. However, challenges remain, as the club now relies on fan and local business support for financial stability. The Well Society's membership has plateaued, and Hutchison emphasizes the need for continued financial contributions from fans and local businesses to ensure the club's sustainability without dependence on wealthy individuals. Hutchison's efforts have left the club in a more stable position, but the Well Society must succeed in managing the club's finances to maintain this stability.",
