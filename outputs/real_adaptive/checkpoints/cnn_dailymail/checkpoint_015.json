    "source": "(The Hollywood Reporter)Richard Dysart, the Emmy-winning actor who portrayed the cranky senior partner Leland McKenzie in the slick, long-running NBC drama \"L.A. Law,\" has died. He was 86. Dysart, who also played Coach in the original 1972 Broadway production of Jason Miller's Pulitzer Prize-winning \"That Championship Season,\" died Sunday at home in Santa Monica after a long illness, his wife, artist Kathryn Jacobi, told The Hollywood Reporter. The acclaimed \"L.A. Law\" — created by Steven Bochco (who eventually handed off the series to David E. Kelley) and Terry Louise Fisher — aired for eight seasons from 1986 to 1994. For playing the founder of the firm McKenzie, Brackman, Chaney and Kuzak, Dysart was nominated for the Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series for four straight years, finally winning the trophy in 1992. \"I always had him in mind for that role,\" Bochco said in a 2002 interview with the Archive of American Television. \"He's so avuncular. So I reached out to him. You know, Dick is sort of an old hippie. So he went into his closet and tried to find a lawyer outfit, and he came to meet us wearing a suit and tie. He was perfect.\" \"We got together, mapped out the character's past to give us a basis from which to work, and it's all gone smoothly since then,\" Dysart said in a 1990 interview with The Seattle Times. \"Sometimes I worry — it's all been going too well — a role I love to play in a series that's about as good as you can get. Something's wrong!\" Perhaps Dysart's most memorable character arc on the show was when he was found in bed with power-hungry competitor Rosalind Shays (played by Diana Muldaur). He was one of the few actors to appear in every episode. Dysart's range of authority -figure parts ran right to the top. He limned Harry Truman in the CBS telefilm \"Day One\" and in the ABC miniseries \"War and Remembrance,\" both of which aired in 1989, and he was Henry L. Stimson, the 33rd U.S. president's Secretary of War, in the 1995 HBO telefilm \"Truman,\" starring Gary Sinise. Similarly, he played the Secretary of Defense in \"Meteor\" (1979). Hollywood Reporter: Most powerful people in N.Y. media . Dysart also performed extensively in the medical- (movie) field, performing enough doctor roles to, perhaps, qualify to practice. His two most memorable came in classic satires: in Paddy Chayevsky's scathing \"The Hospital\" (1971), starring George C. Scott (a good friend), and in \"Being There\" (1979), as Melvyn Douglas' doctor. He also was a doctor who died a gruesome death in John Carpenter's \"The Thing\" (1982) and a physician in such films as \"The Terminal Man\" (1974), \"The Falcon and the Snowman\" (1985) and \"Warning Sign\" (1985). Dysart portrayed J. Edgar Hoover in the 1993 USA telefilm \"Marilyn & Bobby: Her Final Affair\" and in Mario Van Peebles' \"Panther\" (1995). Dysart also excelled as cranky coots and shifty sorts. He portrayed a motel receptionist in Richard Lester's \"Petulia\" (1968); was the bad guy who battled Clint Eastwood in \"Pale Rider\" (1985); stood out as a power player in Oliver Stone's \"Wall Street\" (1987); and sold barbwire in \"Back to the Future III\" (1990). Dysart was born March 30, 1929, in Boston and raised in Maine. Following high school, he attended the Gould Academy in Bethel, Maine, for a year, served in the U.S. Air Force and attended Emerson College, where he graduated with a master's degree in speech communications. At the time, he was interested in a career in radio (he became fascinated with the medium in first grade, when he was bedridden for a year because of rheumatic fever) but was soon tempted by acting. He moved to New York on a whim and was able to land minor roles on TV and a part in an off-Broadway production of \"The Iceman Cometh\" opposite Jason Robards. In the mid-1960s, he joined the American Conservatory Theater and toured the country doing plays, then landed roles on Broadway in \"All in Good Time,\" \"The Little Foxes\" and \"A Place Without Doors.\" He received a Drama Desk Award for his performance in \"That Championship Season.\" Hollywood Reporter: Q&A with Liz Smith . Dysart's credits include an eclectic array of movies, including \"The Crazy World of Julius Vrooder\" (1974), \"The Day of the Locust\" (1975), \"The Hindenburg\" (1975), \"An Enemy of the People\" (1978), \"Prophecy\" (1979), \"Mask\" (1985) and \"Hard Rain\" (1998). On television, he was top-notch in the telefilms \"The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman\" (1974), \"The People vs. Jean Harris\" (1981), as Dwight D. Eisenhower in \"The Last Days of Patton\" (1986) and as studio chief Louis B. Mayer in \"Malice in Wonderland\" (1985). Survivors also include his stepson Arie and daughter-in-law Jeannine Jacobi, mother-in-law Lenore, brother and sister-in-law Nadine and John Jacobi and grandchildren Abby and Levi. A private memorial is being planned. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made to the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum, an outdoor theater in Topanga Canyon in the Los Angeles area. Dysart and Jacobi had a second home in the forests of British Columbia. He was lured out of retirement for his last onscreen appearance, the \"L.A. Law\" reunion telefilm of 2002. \"They remain timely, with cases about points of law that are still current,\" he said of watching \"L.A. Law\" reruns in a 2002 interview with The Bangor Daily News. \"[The show] was also one of the fathers of yuppiedom. It was very much of the times, and very Los Angeles. It holds up as well as any series I know.\" People we've lost in 2015 . ©2015 The Hollywood Reporter. All rights reserved.",

Umpires ejected a total of five players from both teams after the fight in the seventh inning of Thursday's game at Chicago's U.S. Cellular Field,  Illinois. A heated exchange between Royals starter Yordano Ventura and White Sox outfielder Adam Eaton sparked the brawl which saw players from both dugouts and bullpens flood the field, reported New York Daily News. Chicago White Sox's Jeff Samardzija, center, in the brawl with Kansas City Royals players during the seventh inning of Thursday's game . Several punches were thrown and  Ventura, along with fellow teammates Lorenzo Cain and Edinson Volquez, was sent off along with Chicago's Chris Sale and Jeff Samardzija. Thursday's match began to get scrappy after the White Sox's Jose Abreu was hit in the arm by  Ventura's pitch in the fourth inning. The very next inning, Royals' Mike Moustakas was also hit in the arm, this time by a pitch from Chris Sale, leading to a warning for both teams. But things continued to escalate until Eaton hit a comebacker (a ball batted directly back to the pitcher) at Ventura in the seventh inning. The Royals starter picked up a ground ball but instead of throwing it to first for the out, he appeared to stop for a moment and stare at the pitcher. Umpires ejected a total of five players from both teams after the fight after the seventh inning of Thursday's game at Chicago's U.S. Cellular Field, Illinois . The pair exchanged words, and Eaton is alleged to have shouted an expletive at Ventura, who was said to have shouted one back before he threw to first base to end the inning. Things quickly turned ugly and both players had to be kept apart by teammates and umpires. But the whole of both teams ran onto the field for the brawl where there was pushing, shoving and even a few punches. The fight was beginning to calm down and Moustakas was escorting Ventura back to the dugout when Samardzija charged at Cain. However, he missed knocked over coach Mike Jirschele instead. Ventura told ESPN Chicago he regretted the way he'd handled himself. 'It was a messy situation, I got the ground ball and was unable to control my emotions in that play, and it turned out ugly,' Ventura said. Several punches were thrown and Kansas City's Ventura, Lorenzo Cain and Edinson Volquez were ejected along with Chicago's Chris Sale and Jeff Samardzija (pictured going down) The whole of both teams ran onto the field for the brawl where there was pushing, shoving and even a few punches in the brawl . '(Eaton) said something to me. I responded back to him,' he said. 'It wasn't my intention, but maybe he interpreted it from the way I fielded the ball, but it was a hard comebacker, kind of put me off-balance, at which point I took those steps that incited him and he responded back, clearly emotional.' Royals won the game 3-2 in 13 innings, which is the first of a four-game series. This is not the first time the Royals have had tensions with other teams. Last weekend, their clash with Oakland Athletics landed scrappy Ventura with a fine for his actions. He was also  involved in the team's disagreements with the Los Angeles Angels. In the three-game series against the Athletics, the teams clashed almost every match until five players and coaches were thrown out of the finale. They included Royals reliever Kelvin Herrera, who threw that fastball behind the head of Brett  Lawrie and pointed to his own head in a threatening manner. He received a five-game suspension.",

    "source": "Accused: Retired general Sir Frank Kitson (above) won a CBE for his service in the Army . A retired general is being sued over a murder in Northern Ireland more than 40 years ago. Sir Frank Kitson, who is 88, is accused in the case of Patrick Eugene Heenan, a Catholic killed by loyalists in 1973. It is the first time a retired senior officer has been personally sued over the Troubles. Yesterday however, Sir Frank said he was confused as to why he was being named because he was not even serving in Northern Ireland at the time. He learned of the legal action in a letter from a Belfast law firm at the weekend. Mr Heenan, 47, was killed when paramilitaries threw a grenade at a minibus carrying him and 14 others to a Belfast building site. His widow, Mary, is suing the Ministry of Defence and the general, claiming he died because of ‘negligence and misfeasance’. But Sir Frank told the Daily Mail he had no connection to the case. ‘I wasn’t even there in 1973,’ he said. ‘I was in Ireland from September 1970 until April 1972. I know nothing about what happened to Mr Heenan. 'I wasn’t a policy maker, I was a commander of troops. I have absolutely no knowledge of Mr Heenan and I had gone from Ireland at the time of his death.’ Baffled: Sir Frank (pictured), who is now 88, said he was confused as to why he was being named because he was not even serving in Northern Ireland at the time of the murder in 1973 . Sir Frank also denied the claim that he was in charge of military operations in Northern Ireland during the early 1970s: ‘I was not. ‘I was commanding one of three brigades. Above me there was a major general and a lieutenant general. ‘We were working very closely with the police at the time, we have to make our plans together. We never instigated the use of paramilitary gangs.’ Colonel Tim Collins – formerly of the 1st Battalion Royal Irish Regiment – described the decision to pursue General Kitson as strange. He added: ‘Not only is it a strange case, it worries me that such an action is allowed by the authorities and the Government. ‘What is also of concern is that there are people out there who are set to profit by taking cases such as these.’ Kevin Winters, of law firm KRW, said: ‘This week we have issued proceedings against the MoD and Frank Kitson on behalf of our clients, the relatives of Patrick Heenan. 'These are civil proceedings for damages but their core value is to obtain truth and accountability for our clients as to the role of the British Army and Frank Kitson in the counter-insurgency operation in the north of Ireland during the early part of the conflict.’ Royal appointment: Sir Frank (far right) is pictured with the Queen, Major General Patrick Palmer (centre), and Lieutenant General Sir Edward Burgess (left) during a visit to York in May 1983 . He claimed loyalist paramilitary gangs were ‘core to the Kitson military doctrine endorsed by the British Army and the British government at the time’. Eugene Heenan, son of the murdered man, said he and his 88-year-old mother would travel to London on Thursday to generate publicity for the civil action. He added: ‘Kitson may not have been in Ireland when my father was murdered but those who did were working to a template he had developed while in various countries and it is him who has to be held accountable.’ Sir Frank has been named co-defendant in the legal action on grounds that he and others used agents when they knew, or should have known, that they would take part in criminal actions. He was awarded a CBE in February 1972 for ‘gallant and distinguished’ services in Northern Ireland from August 1971 to November 1971. He enjoyed a distinguished career, serving in Oman and Malaya and in Kenya during the Mau Mau rebellion, for which he received the Military Cross in 1955. The general rose to become commander-in-chief UK land forces from 1982 to 1985. Former soldier Albert ‘Ginger’ Baker received a life sentence for killing Mr Heenan and three others but he later claimed to have links to British intelligence. He was a member of the outlawed Ulster Defence Association and known to be a leading member of the so-called ‘Romper Room’ gang. Although no inquest was held into Mr Heenan’s death, it has been claimed he could have survived had first aid been given quickly.",

    "source": "Budget airline easyJet has been charging stranded customers a £10 fee for proof that their flight was cancelled. The charge came to light when customers sought to claim money back from travel insurers after French air-traffic strikes affected flights earlier this month. They were asked to provide an airline letter confirming the cancellation, but easyJet told its hard-hit passengers to pay a £10 fee. Scroll down for video . Compensation: The charge came to light when easyJet customers sought to claim money back from travel insurers after French air-traffic strikes affected flights earlier this month. Above, file image . The Association of European Airlines confirmed last night that no other airline has attempted to charge for this and said customers should not be charged. However, a spokesman for easyJet defended the airline’s position, saying: ‘The administration charge for the letter is applied because each letter has to be individually researched and created for each passenger.’ In an email seen by the Mail in response to one customer’s request, easyJet’s customer service team said: ‘We can certainly send you a letter to help you claim on your insurance, that’s not a problem. ‘There is a small administration fee of 10GBP for the letter, which you should be able to claim back through your insurer.’ There were delays and 1,000 flight cancellations across Europe this month following the 48-hour strike by French air-traffic controllers. EasyJet is France’s second-largest airline and cancelled 588 flights over the two days. The airline launched ‘rescue flights’ to repatriate holidaymakers and children stranded abroad. Ryanair cancelled 500 flights while British Airways and Flybe cancelled fewer than 50 each. Travel chaos: There were delays and 1,000 flight cancellations across Europe this month following the 48-hour strike by French air-traffic controllers. Pictured, passengers queue for check-in at Stansted Airport . And flight cancellations have risen by a fifth in the first quarter of 2015 as services were hit by poor weather as well as the strikes. There were 5,080 cancellations in the first three months of 2015 compared to 4,239 in the same period last year. The number of delayed flights increased by 7 per cent with 2,427 hold-ups compared to 2,260. Monarch had the greatest increase in delays – 30 per cent – with 64 incidents, according to figures from compensation firm EUClaim. Strikes: Ryanair cancelled 500 flights while British Airways and Flybe cancelled fewer than 50 each. Above, a flight information board at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, where several flights were cancelled . EasyJet has seen a 19 per cent increase with 245 delays in the first four months of this year compared to 206 last year. The EUClaim report said: ‘There are two main reasons for the poor start to the year. Firstly the winter weather across Europe has been worse than 2014 this particularly affected Jet2, easyJet and Monarch who suffered considerable delays on their routes to Chambery and Grenoble in France. ‘The second cause has been the number of strikes in Europe. The four-day Lufthansa strike resulted in some 116 cancelled flights to the UK, strikes by Italian air traffic controllers and security staff in Germany has also compounded the problem.’",

The charge came to light when customers sought to claim money back from travel insurers after French air-traffic strikes affected flights earlier this month.

The Association of European Airlines confirmed last night that no other airline has attempted to charge for this and said customers should not be charged. However, a spokesman for easyJet defended the airline's position, saying: 'The administration charge for the letter is applied because each letter has to be individually researched and created for each passenger.' In an email seen by the Mail in response to one customer's request, easyJet's customer service team said: 'We can certainly send you a letter to help you claim on your insurance, that's not a problem.

The EUClaim report said: 'There are two main reasons for the poor start to the year. Firstly the winter weather across Europe has been worse than 2014 this particularly affected Jet2, easyJet and Monarch who suffered considerable delays on their routes to Chambery and Grenoble in France. The second cause has been the number of strikes in Europe.'",

So it was only a matter of time before the make-up industry jumped on the bandwagon. The newest generation of beauty products will be personalised to meet all your particular needs - from bespoke mascaras and eyeliners to foundations and powders unique to you. Scroll down for video . The newest generation of beauty products will be personalised to meet all your particular needs . Eyeko London's Bespoke Mascara (£28) comes in dozens of brush shapes . Eyeko London is just one brand taking advantage of the trend with the launch of its new Bespoke Mascara (£28), offering more than 100 different combinations of brush shape and formula to suit your lashes. At Eyeko's Bespoke Eye Wardrobe in London's Harvey Nichols, which launched earlier this month, customers can choose between dozens of brush shapes - from thick wands for a dramatic Sixties look to skinnier ones for lengthened, separated lashes. The mascaras, containing natural ingredients like conditioning shea butter and hydrating keratin, are created on site and then wrapped in monogrammed packaging to complete the personalised theme. Co-founder Nina Leykind said: 'It's like the Baskin Robbins of mascara. Getting it right is about the combination. One doesn’t work without the other. 'Even if you have an amazing brush for you, if it’s put together with the wrong formula then it doesn’t work.' Foundation, too, is set to see a surge in personalisation. Beauty brands have long promised customised foundation, but finding that perfect shade and texture is easier said than done. Enter Cover FX Custom Cover Drops (£36) a new game-changing alternative to foundation which can transform your entire make-up collection. Cover Drops, which are based on a colour palette of neutral, pink and gold, can be mixed with any of your favourite moisturisers, oils, serums or other foundations to create your preferred texture and finish. Using 'Flash Fusion' technology, as soon as the drops are added to a beauty product, they blend in flawlessly, leaving behind only pure pigments and instant tint. Cover FX Custom Cover Drops (£36) can be mixed with any of your favourite moisturizers, oils, serums or other foundations to create your preferred texture and finish . It's not just make-up that is increasingly becoming tailored to your personal needs. Skincare brand Jennifer Young offers customised moisturisers, serums, cleansers and toners made with the particular ingredients that your skin craves. Customers who visit the Jennifer Young website specify their gender, age, problem areas, preferred scent and skin sensitivities, among other options. They are then presented with a selection of made-to-order products designed to enhance their particular skin type, with prices starting at £20 for a custom-made toner. Not only are beauty brands creating more and more customised products, but shops and department stores are also taking note of the bespoke trend by launching services to help customers create their own blends. Harvey Nichols' newly-launched Beauty Concierge (pictured) is  a personal shopping service  for make-up . Harvey Nichols' newly-launched Beauty Concierge, for instance, is like a personal shopping service specifically for make-up. Customers who book a complimentary appointment meet with a Beauty Adviser, whose mission it is to seek out your ideal lipstick, fragrance or skincare, with no bias towards particular brands. According to Daniela Rinaldi, group beauty buying director at Harvey Nichols, bespoke products are most certainly the future of beauty - and customisation is only going to get bigger. 'I think the one size fits all concept just simply doesn’t cater to customers’ individual needs at all times anymore,' she explained. 'Whilst there is still definitely a market for ready-to-wear beauty, we are seeing an increase in our customers wanting to know that the product they are using is right for them; many don’t want to learn this through a process of trial and error.'",

    "source": "Apple has revealed it will only accept online orders for its much-anticipated watch which goes on sale on the 24th April. The firm will show off the watch to the public for the first time from tomorrow at its retail stores and several special popup stores around the world. From tomorrow morning, customers will be able to preorder their watch online. Scroll down for video . Apple Watch, available for pre-order on Friday, April 10, 2015, comes with a choice of watch case, band and size _ there are 54 possible configurations in all. If you know the specific configuration you want, you're best off ordering it online, starting at 12:01 a.m. PDT Friday (3:01 a.m. EDT). They will start to ship on April 24. Popular models might not be available right away if you're not among the first to order. Your watch will get shipped to you. There won't be an in-store pick-up option. 'We are excited to welcome customers tomorrow and introduce them to Apple Watch, our most personal device yet.said Angela Ahrendts, Apple's senior vice president of Retail and Online Stores. 'Based on the tremendous interest from people visiting our stores, as well as the number of customers who have gone to the Apple Online Store to mark their favourite Apple Watch ahead of availability, we expect that strong customer demand will exceed our supply at launch,' 'To provide the best experience and selection to as many customers as we can, we will be taking orders for Apple Watch exclusively online during the initial launch period.' Customers in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, the UK and the US can try on and experience Apple Watch at their local Apple Store or at Galeries Lafayette in Paris, Isetan in Tokyo, Selfridges in London, and select Apple Authorised Resellers in Japan and China. Customers can pre-order their Apple Watch through the Apple Online Store beginning April 10 at 8:01 a.m. BST for delivery beginning April 24. In stores, customers will get a personalised session with a Specialist to try on, fit and size their band, and explore the amazing features of Apple Watch. Apple says it encourages customers who want to try on an Apple Watch are encouraged to make an appointment online at www.apple.com. Pre-orders begin April 10 at 8:01 a.m. BST through the Apple Online Store and the Apple Store app for iPhone and iPad. Customers who pre-order their Apple Watch can have it shipped for delivery beginning April 24. The watch, when paired with an iPhone, allows users to check email, listen to music and make phone calls. 'Will the Apple Watch change your life? Well, possibly more than many realise until they start using it. 'After a day or two with the watch, a strange thing happened - I completely stopped checking my phone. 'While Apple may be the firm that really creates phone addiction, meaning we are constantly checking our handsets, with the Apple Watch it may have cured it. 'Apple undoubtedly has another hit on its hands with the watch. 'As more and more apps appear, and developers actually get to spend time with it, I fully expect it be used in ways we can’t even imagine now. 'Much like the iPhone, apps could propel this to become a new computing platform - and even with the features it already has, the Apple watch is the most elegant way to communicate digitally.' 'Starting Friday, customers can try on Apple Watch, Apple Watch Sport or Apple Watch Edition to find the model with the size, finish and band to best fit their personal preference and style,' the firm explained. 'Everyone visiting an Apple Store will be able to view all three collections and get hands on with Apple Watch Demo to browse and edit different watch faces, and learn about Apple Watch's health and fitness features, Digital Touch, Siri and more.' Based on a survey in the United States on consumer interest in buying the Apple Watch, BMO Capital Markets has cut its estimate for sales to 39 million units though September 2016. Previously, the analysts had estimated sales of 55.5 million units. About 735 people responded to the survey. Apple is among several companies, including Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Sony Corp, that are jumping into the nascent market for wearable devices. The watch, when paired with an iPhone, allows users to check email, listen to music and make phone calls. Faces on the watch can be customised, and users will be shown this in strore . There is also an app that helps people monitor their health, for example by tracking heartbeats and footsteps. 'We believe in the next five years, the watch will revolutionize the way we interact with objects around us,' Oppenheimer analysts wrote a note on Thursday. Apple shares were up 0.3 percent at $125.98 in early trading on Thursday. Each version of the watch will come in different colour options. Apple's Watch goes on display around the world on 10 April and people can pre-order it at 12.01 Pacific Time (8am BST) on this day. The Watch will then go on general sale on 24 April in the US, UK, Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong and Japan . Apple Watch comes with a choice of watch case, band and size — there are 54 possible configurations in all. Most models come in two sizes, 38 millimeters and 42 millimeters, as measured by the height of the watch face. The larger one costs $50 more in most cases. For a few of the bands, only one size is available. There are three lines to choose from: . The sport, Watch and Edition versions of the smart timepiece . The cheapest is a 'Sport' version with an aluminum case. You can get it with a silver case and choose a white, blue, green or pink band made of synthetic rubber. Or get a grey case with a black band. The smaller version costs $349, and the large one is $399. That's 10 configurations — five bands, each in two sizes. The regular version has a stainless steel case. The cheapest has the same band as the Sport version. You choose white or black and pay $549 for the smaller model and $599 for large. Fancier bands are available — three different leather bands, a link bracelet or a Milanese loop. Prices go as high as $1,099 for a large watch with a stainless steel link bracelet. There are 20 official configurations, but once you factor in some leather bands coming in two or three sizes, you have 32 options to choose from. Edition is the luxury line with cases made of 18-karat gold alloy. It's $10,000 for a small version with the white or black band that comes with Sport models. The large one costs $12,000. You can get a leather band for $15,000 or $17,000, depending on the size. There are officially eight luxury configurations, or 12 if you count band sizes as choices. Apple is also selling bands separately for those who like to swap designs. Prices range from $49 for the basic sport band to $449 for a link bracelet. To help you choose, Apple has plenty of videos on its website and Apple Store and Apple Watch apps. The Apple Store app also has sizing guides, images of the watch cases in actual size and animation of buckles and clasps, which you can open and close by pinching in and out.",

Thanks to these benefits, mahonia has been used traditionally for skin itchiness, infections and irritations, and is highly recommended for acne.

Antimicrobial herb calendula is rich in anti-ageing antioxidant beta-carotene, which is important for healthy skin structure and renewal. Also known as magnolia vine, schisandra has been used historically for immune support and for skin care. Modern Chinese research suggests it has a protective effect on the liver, so enhancing the cleansing benefits. The succulent globe artichoke, meanwhile, has been used in Chinese medicine for millennia as a digestive cleanser. It helps to purify and calm the system from within.

    "source": "Fireman Stephen Hunt, 38, died after he and a colleague got into difficulties battling a fire started at Paul's Hair World in Manchester's Northern Quarter on July 13, 2013 . A 16-year-old girl charged with arson after she discarded a cigarette causing a city centre shop blaze which claimed the life of a firefighter had the charge dropped today after a judge said she was 'guilty only of being careless'. Fireman Stephen Hunt, 38, lost his life tackling the inferno which began at Paul's Hair World in Manchester's Northern Quarter almost two years ago. The girl - who was just 15 at the time - is said to have dropped a cigarette to the floor while standing near the shop's fire exit which rolled underneath the door and set boxes alight. She was originally charged with arson being reckless as to whether life was endangered, but was cleared having been due to stand trial on Monday. After more than a year of legal wrangling, with scientists initially stating that the fire could not have been started accidentally, further investigation led to the conclusion a discarded cigarette could have been the cause. More than 60 firefighters battled the blaze, which erupted on July 13, 2013, as frightened passers-by watched on. Father-of-two Mr Hunt, of Whitefield, Manchester, and another fireman, got into difficulties while tackling the fire and they were rushed to hospital where Mr Hunt was pronounced dead. At Manchester Crown Court, prosecutor Alexander Leach said thin and damaged cardboard boxes and paper labels stored behind the fire door at the business may well have caught fire if a cigarette was discarded. He said: 'Combined with the suggestion that boxes may have been on top of the smouldering cigarette, compressing and containing the heat, this made it more likely items would ignite. The salon was totally gutted when an inferno started by a discarded cigarette ripped through it. The 16-year-old girl who started the fire was today told she will not face trial for arson as she had only been 'careless' The family of Stephen Hunt visit the scene where he died. The girl who started the fire is said to have dropped a cigarette while standing near the shop's fire exit which rolled underneath the door and set boxes alight . Firefighters enter the remains of music venue NQ Live in Manchester which was also destroyed by the fire (left). Dozens of floral tributes to fireman Stephen Hunt were left at the scene (right) 'It was a hot day and there was a gap beneath the door and as a result experts were unable to exclude a chimney effect as air was drawn under the gap underneath the door and the fire began. 'The conclusion is the Crown's case, which had previously been based on scientific evidence which excluded accidental ignition, can no longer be sustained, so I offer no evidence.' The teenager, who did not attend court, was initially arrested along with another 15-year-old girl but she was the only one charged. Throwing the case out, Judge Michael Henshell said: 'I spent some time reading the papers and reports and it is perfectly obvious this terrible and tragic case demonstrates the danger and potential danger from discarded cigarettes. A fireman patrols the scene in Manchester's Northern Quarter where his colleague was killed. More than 1,000 firefighters, emergency service staff and members of the public lined the streets of Bury for Mr Hunt's funeral . More than 60 firefighters battled the blaze, which erupted on July 13, 2013, as passers-by watched on . 'This was discarded without any thought and as a result a fire started in circumstances which were particular to the site in question, resulting in extensive damage and costing the life of a man who, as part of his employment, was there to protect life and property. 'It was a terrible consequence for a thoughtless act. The girl who had been charged and faced trial was, in fact, blameless so far as criminal law is concerned and guilty only of being careless.' In September 2013 more than 1,000 firefighters, emergency service staff and members of the public lined the streets of Bury for Mr Hunt's funeral. In a tribute to him at his funeral, his son Sam said: 'To me, he wasn't just my dad but my hero, my role model and my best friend.' Following the hearing today, a spokesperson for Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said: 'We have made no comment on any aspect of the incident and are unlikely to do so until the coroner's inquest into Stephen's death has concluded. 'Safe to say we continue to work with everyone involved in various investigations to find the truth of what happened, not least for Stephen's family but for everyone involved and especially our firefighters.'",

After more than a year of legal wrangling, with scientists initially stating that the fire could not have been started accidentally, further investigation led to the conclusion a discarded cigarette could have been the cause. At Manchester Crown Court, prosecutor Alexander Leach said thin and damaged cardboard boxes and paper labels stored behind the fire door at the business may well have caught fire if a cigarette was discarded. The teenager, who did not attend court, was initially arrested along with another 15-year-old girl but she was the only one charged. Judge Michael Henshell said: 'It was a terrible consequence for a thoughtless act. The girl who had been charged and faced trial was, in fact, blameless so far as criminal law is concerned and guilty only of being careless.'",

    "source": "Mario Balotelli revealed his delight on Twitter after Manchester City forward Sergio Aguero struck early on against Manchester United, even though City's eventual defeat was good news for Liverpool. Argentine striker Aguero opened the scoring after eight minutes at Old Trafford, and his controversial former City team-mate took the opportunity to lay into his biggest rivals from his time at the Etihad Stadium and at Anfield. Balotelli tweeted: 'Yeeeees city @aguerosergiokun !!! 1-0 OLD TRAFFORD...Stand up and shut up.' Mario Balotelli revealed his delight on Twitter after Manchester City scored early on in the Manchester derby . Balotelli tweeted: 'Yeeeees city @aguerosergiokun !!! 1-0 OLD TRAFFORD...Stand up and shut up.' Sergio Aguero struck after eight minutes to give City the lead but they were blitzed by United in a 4-2 loss . Despite Balotelli's gloating, the defeat for City is actually more beneficial to his Liverpool side . While United's blitz of City went on to leave the Italian red-faced anyway, the fact that a defeat for the champions was beneficial for his current club will not have gone unnoticed either. Instead, Balotelli seemed to throw his weight behind his former employers rather than clinging on to Liverpool's slim hopes of Champions League qualification that look like they will only open up if City's slump continues. Liverpool - and Balotelli - face Newcastle United on Monday night with the chance of closing the gap on City in fourth to four points in the Barclays Premier League. Controversial striker Balotelli listens in as Brendan Rodgers talks his team through a training session . Balotelli and his Liverpool team-mates face Newcastle United on Monday clinging to their top four hopes . And with Manuel Pellegrini's side having lost six of their last eight in all competitions the Anfield club maintain a small chance of taking a top four place, even if it isn't at the top of Balotelli's list of priorities. The 24-year-old has had his run-ins with the red half of Manchester before, famously celebrating a goal with his 'Why always me' shirt at Old Trafford in 2011 and clashing with Rio Ferdinand after a win over United at Wembley in the same year.",

    "generated": "• Sergio Aguero scored early for Manchester City at Old Trafford, prompting former City striker Mario Balotelli to taunt Manchester United on Twitter - though City would ultimately lose the match\n\n• The City defeat could benefit Liverpool's Champions League hopes, with the Reds able to close gap to just 4 points behind struggling City (who have lost 6 of their last 8 games)\n\n• Balotelli's support of City comes despite currently playing for Liverpool, creating an awkward situation given Liverpool's chase for City's Champions League spot\n\n• The Italian striker has history of provocative behavior against Manchester United, most famously wearing a 'Why always me?' shirt while celebrating at Old Trafford in 2011\n\n• He was also involved in a notable altercation with United's Rio Ferdinand at Wembley that same year",

But after 15 blissful years skipping over legal hurdles, it all came to a grinding halt when she was stopped for a traffic violation. Police started to investigate Parker after realizing she gave the traffic officers a false name. Tracking down her house, they found she was leasing under another false name. The case quickly unraveled into one of the biggest cases of identity theft the state has ever seen. Master con? Cathryn Parker, 72, has been living as 74 different people, mainly Hollywood production staffers . 'I've been a cop for 20 years... and this is the first case where I've had this many aliases,' LAPD's Detective Danny Gore told the LA Times. He predicted Parker would have continued to operate under the various identities for the rest of her life. 'It's like a way of life. I don't know that there was an end,' he remarked. 'You have to be dedicated.' Efforts to find a phone number for Parker were unsuccessful. It wasn't immediately known if she has an attorney. As of Friday, Parker was in federal custody in Northern California, where she was wanted for probation violations. She was convicted in 2000 for federal mail fraud in Hawaii after she used the Jenny Craig Corp's corporate travel account to purchase plane tickets and then sold the tickets privately for $500 apiece. Parker has repeatedly violated the terms of her release since then and was wanted by the U.S. Marshals, according to records. According to police, she also paid utilities under false names and acquired credit cards with other people's financial information. After she serves time in Northern California, she'll be sent down to Los Angeles County to answer for the alleged identity thefts, Deputy U.S. Marshal Laura Vega said. Until that time, investigators are looking for more victims. Though the current victims only date back to 2012, Gore said he believes there could be incidents going back to 2010.

The incident is difficult to comprehend as the collision was much more than just a minor skirmish on the tarmac at the busy Asian airport. The damage on the vehicle is clear, although it is unknown if the engine of the Boeing 777 jet was damaged or if anyone was injured. The bus ploughed into the engine of the Uzbekistan Airways Boeing 777 passenger jet . Tashkent is the largest international airport in Uzbekistan, and the busiest in Central Asia, so the crash will have more than likely delayed many passengers. The plane was believed to be an Uzbekistan Airways service, the national airline of the country, with its headquarters at Tashkent. MailOnline Travel has contacted Uzbekistan Airways and is awaiting comment. This kind of incident is unfortunately becoming more common. Ryanair passengers travelling to Edinburgh and Zadar, Croatia were delayed for hours after two of the budget airline’s planes clipped wings at Dublin Airport back on April 1. Photos snapped by travellers show the tip of a winglet dangling by a thread after clipping the other plane - and it's the second time in six months two Ryanair planes have collided at Ireland's busiest airport. It's difficult to comprehend the moments leading up the crash as the force of impact is severe . Passengers escaped injury when the planes collided as they taxied to a runway shortly before 8am, but the incident caused disruption for hundreds of travellers. In October 2014 a Ryanair jet had its winglet torn off when it collided with another plane belonging to the budget carrier at Dublin Airport. The Boeing 737s heading to Edinburgh and Brussels were taxiing to a runway when they collided in darkness. In January this year a British Airways plane hit a hangar at Heathrow Airport, while being towed away for routine maintenance. As the Boeing 777-200 aircraft was being towed towards a hangar, someone misjudged the distance and the plane's wing clipped the wall of a nearby building. There were no injuries from the collision, and the airport and airline continued to operate normally for the rest of the day.",

Tashkent is the largest international airport in Uzbekistan, and the busiest in Central Asia, so the crash will have more than likely delayed many passengers. The plane was believed to be an Uzbekistan Airways service, the national airline of the country, with its headquarters at Tashkent.

    "source": "(CNN)Pop star Taylor Swift, who has built an intense bond with her fans by sharing personal details of her life, revealed some sobering news Thursday: Her mother has cancer. The singer did not divulge the nature or severity of the cancer, saying \"I'd like to keep the details of her condition and treatment plans private.\" Andrea Swift, 57, who years ago quit her job as a mutual fund marketing executive to raise Swift and Swift's younger brother, Austin, has joined her famous daughter on tour and in several of her videos. In a post on Tumblr, the blogging platform, Swift said that for Christmas last year, she asked her mom to get screened for potential health issues, \"just to ease some worries of mine.\" Her mother felt \"perfectly fine\" but went to the doctor for tests anyway \"just to get me and my brother off her case\" about it. \"The results came in, and I'm saddened to tell you that my mom has been diagnosed with cancer. I'd like to keep the details of her condition and treatment plans private, but she wanted you to know,\" Swift added. #PrayForMamaSwift was a trending hashtag Thursday on Twitter, where Swift's legions of fans offered prayers and messages of support. Within an hour and a half, Swift's tweet about her mom had been retweeted more than 21,000 times. Many fans shared \"there's something in your eyes that says we can beat this,\" a lyric from Swift's 2008 song \"Change.\" Swift also urged her fans to make sure their parents get screened for cancer and other potential health problems. \"She wanted you to know because your parents may be too busy juggling everything they've got going on to go to the doctor, and maybe you reminding them to go get checked for cancer could possibly lead to an early diagnosis and an easier battle ...\" she wrote. \"Or peace of mind in knowing that they're healthy and there's nothing to worry about.\" Swift, 25, added that \"usually when things happen to me, I process them and then write music about how I feel, and you hear it much later. This is something my family and I thought you should know about now. \"Thank you for caring about my family so much that she would want me to share this information with you. I hope and pray that you never get news like this.\" Andrea Swift and Swift's father, Scott Kingsley Swift, live in Nashville, Tennessee, in a mansion bought by their daughter in 2011 for $2.5 million.",

In a post on Tumblr, the blogging platform, Swift said that for Christmas last year, she asked her mom to get screened for potential health issues, \"just to ease some worries of mine.\" Her mother felt \"perfectly fine\" but went to the doctor for tests anyway \"just to get me and my brother off her case\" about it.",

    "source": "Rangers kept the pressure on Hibernian in the race for second spot in the Championship with a comfortable 4-0 win over Raith Rovers. Hibs had secured a win over Hearts in the Edinburgh derby in the earlier kick-off and the Light Blues knew they had to respond. They bounced back from Thursday's defeat by Queen of the South, with Nicky Clark and Haris Vuckic claiming a goal apiece and Nicky Law grabbing a double. Nicky Clark celebrates after putting Rangers 1-0 up against Raith Rovers on Sunday . Clark in the air as he heads the ball towards goal to give the hosts the lead at Ibrox . Rangers manager Stuart McCall applauds the home fans after the full-time whistle . The win means Rangers and Hibs remain level on 61 points, albeit the Leith side have the better goal difference. Stuart McCall had suffered his first defeat as Rangers manager against Queens last week. So it was no real surprise to see him make three changes for the visit of Raith. Goalkeeper Cammy Bell was back between the sticks and Dean Shiels and Robbie Crawford were also added to the side. The Light Blues enjoyed the best possible start to the game when they surged into the lead after just six minutes. Clark found himself in plenty of space to connect with Law's corner and bullet a header home from 10 yards. Law then carved out a chance of his own but his shot from just inside the box was weak and easily held by Kevin Cuthbert. But the goalkeeper had no chance when Gers claimed their second of the day after 27 minutes. Vuckic cut inside from the right before unleashing a powerful drive into the bottom corner to claim his seventh Rangers goal. Haris Vuckic (left) fires the ball home to put Rangers 2-0 ahead against Raith Rovers . Vuckic (left) celebrates his Ibrox goal with team-mate Kenny Miller . Nicky Law slots it home to get the first of his two goals for Rangers on Sunday afternoon . Law (right) wheels away as he celebrates his goal for the home side . Raith could have pulled a goal back moments later but a well-struck free-kick from Ryan Conroy on the edge of the box was blocked by Bell. The visitors fired out another warning to Rangers shortly after the restart. Lewis Vaughan tried his luck with a snap-shot that fell inches past the upright as Raith tried to haul themselves back into the game. At the other end, the hosts passed up a decent chance to all but secure the three points. Vuckic released Crawford and he tried to tee up the shot for Law but he failed to connect in front of goal and the chance was lost. However Law was celebrating when he added his name to the scoresheet after 72 minutes, putting the game beyond Raith. Law's first attempt crashed off the crossbar but the ball fell kindly to his feet and he had the net bulging with the rebound from eight yards. Tom Walsh then saw a terrific volley saved well by the goalkeeper, before Law completed his double when he curled home from the edge of the box with two minutes to go. Law (left) strikes the ball towards goal as he scores Rangers' fourth goal of the afternoon . Law (left) is congratulated by his Rangers team-mates on his Sunday afternoon double . Former Rangers striker Michael Mols was among those in the directors' box at Ibrox on Sunday .",

    "source": "Margaret Gretton has been banned from classrooms for labelling an Asian job applicant 'Taliban' and calling special needs pupils 'roadkill' A primary school headteacher has been banned from classrooms for labelling an Asian job applicant 'Taliban' after referring to special needs pupils as 'roadkill'. Margaret Gretton, 46, has been barred indefinitely from the profession after she referred to the applicant as a member of the terror group and talked of 'bombs and blowing up the school' in an Asian accent. A disciplinary panel of the National College for Teaching and Leadership in Coventry ruled Ms Gretton 'exhibited clear intolerance on the grounds of race, as well as disability'. The panel said she showed no remorse for 'deliberate' and 'repeated' actions while head of Burton Joyce Primary School in Nottingham. They heard that she had mocked special needs students by referring to them as 'cuckoo' and said she didn't want to encourage children 'like that' to come to the school. She even displayed a Golly magnet in her office and made 'monkey noises' on one occasion when talking about black people. Her shocking behaviour continued over a 'sustained period of time' while she was headteacher of the school from September 2007 until November 2013. The panel concluded Ms Gretton 'displayed racist attitudes and behaviour in that - on one or more occasions you inappropriately commented in relation to a photograph of a male Asian job applicant.' It said her comments included 'would you hire me…I'm in the Taliban', or words to that effect, referring to the man as 'Mohammed', or words to that effect, and referring to 'bombs and blowing up the school', or words to that effect, in an Asian accent. A teacher at the school, named only as Staff Member E, told the panel that Ms Gretton said to her, unprompted: 'Do you like black men?' The teacher said she was 'taken aback' by the question, but added that it did not bother her, and her mother's partner was black and from Jamaica. She told the panel that Ms Gretton then 'burst out laughing and said words to the effect of 'does he have big lips?...does he look like a monkey?' and then went on to make monkey noises.' The headteacher denied making the comments, but the panel said it was 'satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the comments, or words similar to them, were made by Ms Gretton. ' The panel also found that she 'expressed inappropriate and discriminatory attitudes towards SEN [Special Educational Needs] pupils in the presence of school staff.' The panel said 'exhibited clear intolerance on the grounds of race, as well as disability' while head of Burton Joyce Primary School in Nottingham (pictured) They said she had used the word 'cuckoo' or words to that affect and said 'we don't want to encourage children like that to come here.' She was also found to have 'deliberately tried to upset' a special needs pupil, 'frightened him', and 'tried to make him cry.' Witness G gave evidence to the panel that on one occasion in 2010 a pupil would not come out from underneath a table and was disrupting the lesson so, as a teaching assistant, she asked Ms Gretton for assistance. She told the panel that 'Ms Gretton said 'It's like something from One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest' and said 'cuckoo, cuckoo' whilst twirling her finger at the side of her head.' A Special Education Needs co-ordinator, who also gave evidence to the panel, said that during a discussion in 2010 about creating a disabled parking space at the school car park she mentioned that Ms Gretton's parking space was the obvious place to put it. However she said that Ms Gretton said: 'We don't want to encourage people like that here.' Ms Gretton was also found to have bullied members of staff which the panel described as 'wholly unacceptable.' It concluded: 'The panel considered that Ms Gretton was not acting under duress, she lacked any insight into her behaviour and demonstrated no remorse. Her shocking behaviour continued over a 'sustained period of time' while she was headteacher of the school (pictured)  from September 2007 until November 2013 . 'Her actions towards staff and pupils were deliberate, repeated and over a sustained period of time. Ms Gretton seriously abused her position of power and trust within the school. ' After the panel made its recommendations Paul Heathcote, acting on behalf of the Secretary of State, decided to prohibit Ms Gretton from teaching indefinitely. He said: 'This is a case where the teacher has exhibited clear intolerance on the grounds of race, as well as disability.' He added: 'There has been no effort made by Ms Gretton to remedy the attitudinal deficiencies which have led her to behave in the way in which she did.' Describing his decision to prohibit the woman from teaching he said: ' This means that Ms Margaret Leandra Gretton is prohibited from teaching indefinitely and cannot teach in any school, sixth form college, relevant youth accommodation or children's home in England. 'Furthermore, in view of the seriousness of the allegations found proved against her, I have decided that Ms Margaret Leandra Gretton shall not be entitled to apply for restoration of her eligibility to teach.' Ms Gretton has right of appeal to the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court, until 28 days after she was given notice of the order.",
