    "source": "(The Hollywood Reporter)Richard Dysart, the Emmy-winning actor who portrayed the cranky senior partner Leland McKenzie in the slick, long-running NBC drama \"L.A. Law,\" has died. He was 86. Dysart, who also played Coach in the original 1972 Broadway production of Jason Miller's Pulitzer Prize-winning \"That Championship Season,\" died Sunday at home in Santa Monica after a long illness, his wife, artist Kathryn Jacobi, told The Hollywood Reporter. The acclaimed \"L.A. Law\" — created by Steven Bochco (who eventually handed off the series to David E. Kelley) and Terry Louise Fisher — aired for eight seasons from 1986 to 1994. For playing the founder of the firm McKenzie, Brackman, Chaney and Kuzak, Dysart was nominated for the Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series for four straight years, finally winning the trophy in 1992. \"I always had him in mind for that role,\" Bochco said in a 2002 interview with the Archive of American Television. \"He's so avuncular. So I reached out to him. You know, Dick is sort of an old hippie. So he went into his closet and tried to find a lawyer outfit, and he came to meet us wearing a suit and tie. He was perfect.\" \"We got together, mapped out the character's past to give us a basis from which to work, and it's all gone smoothly since then,\" Dysart said in a 1990 interview with The Seattle Times. \"Sometimes I worry — it's all been going too well — a role I love to play in a series that's about as good as you can get. Something's wrong!\" Perhaps Dysart's most memorable character arc on the show was when he was found in bed with power-hungry competitor Rosalind Shays (played by Diana Muldaur). He was one of the few actors to appear in every episode. Dysart's range of authority -figure parts ran right to the top. He limned Harry Truman in the CBS telefilm \"Day One\" and in the ABC miniseries \"War and Remembrance,\" both of which aired in 1989, and he was Henry L. Stimson, the 33rd U.S. president's Secretary of War, in the 1995 HBO telefilm \"Truman,\" starring Gary Sinise. Similarly, he played the Secretary of Defense in \"Meteor\" (1979). Hollywood Reporter: Most powerful people in N.Y. media . Dysart also performed extensively in the medical- (movie) field, performing enough doctor roles to, perhaps, qualify to practice. His two most memorable came in classic satires: in Paddy Chayevsky's scathing \"The Hospital\" (1971), starring George C. Scott (a good friend), and in \"Being There\" (1979), as Melvyn Douglas' doctor. He also was a doctor who died a gruesome death in John Carpenter's \"The Thing\" (1982) and a physician in such films as \"The Terminal Man\" (1974), \"The Falcon and the Snowman\" (1985) and \"Warning Sign\" (1985). Dysart portrayed J. Edgar Hoover in the 1993 USA telefilm \"Marilyn & Bobby: Her Final Affair\" and in Mario Van Peebles' \"Panther\" (1995). Dysart also excelled as cranky coots and shifty sorts. He portrayed a motel receptionist in Richard Lester's \"Petulia\" (1968); was the bad guy who battled Clint Eastwood in \"Pale Rider\" (1985); stood out as a power player in Oliver Stone's \"Wall Street\" (1987); and sold barbwire in \"Back to the Future III\" (1990). Dysart was born March 30, 1929, in Boston and raised in Maine. Following high school, he attended the Gould Academy in Bethel, Maine, for a year, served in the U.S. Air Force and attended Emerson College, where he graduated with a master's degree in speech communications. At the time, he was interested in a career in radio (he became fascinated with the medium in first grade, when he was bedridden for a year because of rheumatic fever) but was soon tempted by acting. He moved to New York on a whim and was able to land minor roles on TV and a part in an off-Broadway production of \"The Iceman Cometh\" opposite Jason Robards. In the mid-1960s, he joined the American Conservatory Theater and toured the country doing plays, then landed roles on Broadway in \"All in Good Time,\" \"The Little Foxes\" and \"A Place Without Doors.\" He received a Drama Desk Award for his performance in \"That Championship Season.\" Hollywood Reporter: Q&A with Liz Smith . Dysart's credits include an eclectic array of movies, including \"The Crazy World of Julius Vrooder\" (1974), \"The Day of the Locust\" (1975), \"The Hindenburg\" (1975), \"An Enemy of the People\" (1978), \"Prophecy\" (1979), \"Mask\" (1985) and \"Hard Rain\" (1998). On television, he was top-notch in the telefilms \"The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman\" (1974), \"The People vs. Jean Harris\" (1981), as Dwight D. Eisenhower in \"The Last Days of Patton\" (1986) and as studio chief Louis B. Mayer in \"Malice in Wonderland\" (1985). Survivors also include his stepson Arie and daughter-in-law Jeannine Jacobi, mother-in-law Lenore, brother and sister-in-law Nadine and John Jacobi and grandchildren Abby and Levi. A private memorial is being planned. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made to the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum, an outdoor theater in Topanga Canyon in the Los Angeles area. Dysart and Jacobi had a second home in the forests of British Columbia. He was lured out of retirement for his last onscreen appearance, the \"L.A. Law\" reunion telefilm of 2002. \"They remain timely, with cases about points of law that are still current,\" he said of watching \"L.A. Law\" reruns in a 2002 interview with The Bangor Daily News. \"[The show] was also one of the fathers of yuppiedom. It was very much of the times, and very Los Angeles. It holds up as well as any series I know.\" People we've lost in 2015 . ©2015 The Hollywood Reporter. All rights reserved.",

Umpires ejected a total of five players from both teams after the fight in the seventh inning of Thursday's game at Chicago's U.S. Cellular Field,  Illinois. A heated exchange between Royals starter Yordano Ventura and White Sox outfielder Adam Eaton sparked the brawl which saw players from both dugouts and bullpens flood the field, reported New York Daily News. Chicago White Sox's Jeff Samardzija, center, in the brawl with Kansas City Royals players during the seventh inning of Thursday's game . Several punches were thrown and  Ventura, along with fellow teammates Lorenzo Cain and Edinson Volquez, was sent off along with Chicago's Chris Sale and Jeff Samardzija. Thursday's match began to get scrappy after the White Sox's Jose Abreu was hit in the arm by  Ventura's pitch in the fourth inning. The very next inning, Royals' Mike Moustakas was also hit in the arm, this time by a pitch from Chris Sale, leading to a warning for both teams. But things continued to escalate until Eaton hit a comebacker (a ball batted directly back to the pitcher) at Ventura in the seventh inning. The Royals starter picked up a ground ball but instead of throwing it to first for the out, he appeared to stop for a moment and stare at the pitcher. Umpires ejected a total of five players from both teams after the fight after the seventh inning of Thursday's game at Chicago's U.S. Cellular Field, Illinois . The pair exchanged words, and Eaton is alleged to have shouted an expletive at Ventura, who was said to have shouted one back before he threw to first base to end the inning. Things quickly turned ugly and both players had to be kept apart by teammates and umpires. But the whole of both teams ran onto the field for the brawl where there was pushing, shoving and even a few punches. The fight was beginning to calm down and Moustakas was escorting Ventura back to the dugout when Samardzija charged at Cain. However, he missed knocked over coach Mike Jirschele instead. Ventura told ESPN Chicago he regretted the way he'd handled himself. 'It was a messy situation, I got the ground ball and was unable to control my emotions in that play, and it turned out ugly,' Ventura said. Several punches were thrown and Kansas City's Ventura, Lorenzo Cain and Edinson Volquez were ejected along with Chicago's Chris Sale and Jeff Samardzija (pictured going down) The whole of both teams ran onto the field for the brawl where there was pushing, shoving and even a few punches in the brawl . '(Eaton) said something to me. I responded back to him,' he said. 'It wasn't my intention, but maybe he interpreted it from the way I fielded the ball, but it was a hard comebacker, kind of put me off-balance, at which point I took those steps that incited him and he responded back, clearly emotional.' Royals won the game 3-2 in 13 innings, which is the first of a four-game series. This is not the first time the Royals have had tensions with other teams. Last weekend, their clash with Oakland Athletics landed scrappy Ventura with a fine for his actions. He was also  involved in the team's disagreements with the Los Angeles Angels. In the three-game series against the Athletics, the teams clashed almost every match until five players and coaches were thrown out of the finale. They included Royals reliever Kelvin Herrera, who threw that fastball behind the head of Brett  Lawrie and pointed to his own head in a threatening manner. He received a five-game suspension.",

    "source": "Accused: Retired general Sir Frank Kitson (above) won a CBE for his service in the Army . A retired general is being sued over a murder in Northern Ireland more than 40 years ago. Sir Frank Kitson, who is 88, is accused in the case of Patrick Eugene Heenan, a Catholic killed by loyalists in 1973. It is the first time a retired senior officer has been personally sued over the Troubles. Yesterday however, Sir Frank said he was confused as to why he was being named because he was not even serving in Northern Ireland at the time. He learned of the legal action in a letter from a Belfast law firm at the weekend. Mr Heenan, 47, was killed when paramilitaries threw a grenade at a minibus carrying him and 14 others to a Belfast building site. His widow, Mary, is suing the Ministry of Defence and the general, claiming he died because of ‘negligence and misfeasance’. But Sir Frank told the Daily Mail he had no connection to the case. ‘I wasn’t even there in 1973,’ he said. ‘I was in Ireland from September 1970 until April 1972. I know nothing about what happened to Mr Heenan. 'I wasn’t a policy maker, I was a commander of troops. I have absolutely no knowledge of Mr Heenan and I had gone from Ireland at the time of his death.’ Baffled: Sir Frank (pictured), who is now 88, said he was confused as to why he was being named because he was not even serving in Northern Ireland at the time of the murder in 1973 . Sir Frank also denied the claim that he was in charge of military operations in Northern Ireland during the early 1970s: ‘I was not. ‘I was commanding one of three brigades. Above me there was a major general and a lieutenant general. ‘We were working very closely with the police at the time, we have to make our plans together. We never instigated the use of paramilitary gangs.’ Colonel Tim Collins – formerly of the 1st Battalion Royal Irish Regiment – described the decision to pursue General Kitson as strange. He added: ‘Not only is it a strange case, it worries me that such an action is allowed by the authorities and the Government. ‘What is also of concern is that there are people out there who are set to profit by taking cases such as these.’ Kevin Winters, of law firm KRW, said: ‘This week we have issued proceedings against the MoD and Frank Kitson on behalf of our clients, the relatives of Patrick Heenan. 'These are civil proceedings for damages but their core value is to obtain truth and accountability for our clients as to the role of the British Army and Frank Kitson in the counter-insurgency operation in the north of Ireland during the early part of the conflict.’ Royal appointment: Sir Frank (far right) is pictured with the Queen, Major General Patrick Palmer (centre), and Lieutenant General Sir Edward Burgess (left) during a visit to York in May 1983 . He claimed loyalist paramilitary gangs were ‘core to the Kitson military doctrine endorsed by the British Army and the British government at the time’. Eugene Heenan, son of the murdered man, said he and his 88-year-old mother would travel to London on Thursday to generate publicity for the civil action. He added: ‘Kitson may not have been in Ireland when my father was murdered but those who did were working to a template he had developed while in various countries and it is him who has to be held accountable.’ Sir Frank has been named co-defendant in the legal action on grounds that he and others used agents when they knew, or should have known, that they would take part in criminal actions. He was awarded a CBE in February 1972 for ‘gallant and distinguished’ services in Northern Ireland from August 1971 to November 1971. He enjoyed a distinguished career, serving in Oman and Malaya and in Kenya during the Mau Mau rebellion, for which he received the Military Cross in 1955. The general rose to become commander-in-chief UK land forces from 1982 to 1985. Former soldier Albert ‘Ginger’ Baker received a life sentence for killing Mr Heenan and three others but he later claimed to have links to British intelligence. He was a member of the outlawed Ulster Defence Association and known to be a leading member of the so-called ‘Romper Room’ gang. Although no inquest was held into Mr Heenan’s death, it has been claimed he could have survived had first aid been given quickly.",

    "source": "Budget airline easyJet has been charging stranded customers a £10 fee for proof that their flight was cancelled. The charge came to light when customers sought to claim money back from travel insurers after French air-traffic strikes affected flights earlier this month. They were asked to provide an airline letter confirming the cancellation, but easyJet told its hard-hit passengers to pay a £10 fee. Scroll down for video . Compensation: The charge came to light when easyJet customers sought to claim money back from travel insurers after French air-traffic strikes affected flights earlier this month. Above, file image . The Association of European Airlines confirmed last night that no other airline has attempted to charge for this and said customers should not be charged. However, a spokesman for easyJet defended the airline’s position, saying: ‘The administration charge for the letter is applied because each letter has to be individually researched and created for each passenger.’ In an email seen by the Mail in response to one customer’s request, easyJet’s customer service team said: ‘We can certainly send you a letter to help you claim on your insurance, that’s not a problem. ‘There is a small administration fee of 10GBP for the letter, which you should be able to claim back through your insurer.’ There were delays and 1,000 flight cancellations across Europe this month following the 48-hour strike by French air-traffic controllers. EasyJet is France’s second-largest airline and cancelled 588 flights over the two days. The airline launched ‘rescue flights’ to repatriate holidaymakers and children stranded abroad. Ryanair cancelled 500 flights while British Airways and Flybe cancelled fewer than 50 each. Travel chaos: There were delays and 1,000 flight cancellations across Europe this month following the 48-hour strike by French air-traffic controllers. Pictured, passengers queue for check-in at Stansted Airport . And flight cancellations have risen by a fifth in the first quarter of 2015 as services were hit by poor weather as well as the strikes. There were 5,080 cancellations in the first three months of 2015 compared to 4,239 in the same period last year. The number of delayed flights increased by 7 per cent with 2,427 hold-ups compared to 2,260. Monarch had the greatest increase in delays – 30 per cent – with 64 incidents, according to figures from compensation firm EUClaim. Strikes: Ryanair cancelled 500 flights while British Airways and Flybe cancelled fewer than 50 each. Above, a flight information board at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, where several flights were cancelled . EasyJet has seen a 19 per cent increase with 245 delays in the first four months of this year compared to 206 last year. The EUClaim report said: ‘There are two main reasons for the poor start to the year. Firstly the winter weather across Europe has been worse than 2014 this particularly affected Jet2, easyJet and Monarch who suffered considerable delays on their routes to Chambery and Grenoble in France. ‘The second cause has been the number of strikes in Europe. The four-day Lufthansa strike resulted in some 116 cancelled flights to the UK, strikes by Italian air traffic controllers and security staff in Germany has also compounded the problem.’",

The charge came to light when customers sought to claim money back from travel insurers after French air-traffic strikes affected flights earlier this month.

The Association of European Airlines confirmed last night that no other airline has attempted to charge for this and said customers should not be charged. However, a spokesman for easyJet defended the airline's position, saying: 'The administration charge for the letter is applied because each letter has to be individually researched and created for each passenger.' In an email seen by the Mail in response to one customer's request, easyJet's customer service team said: 'We can certainly send you a letter to help you claim on your insurance, that's not a problem.

The EUClaim report said: 'There are two main reasons for the poor start to the year. Firstly the winter weather across Europe has been worse than 2014 this particularly affected Jet2, easyJet and Monarch who suffered considerable delays on their routes to Chambery and Grenoble in France. The second cause has been the number of strikes in Europe.'",

So it was only a matter of time before the make-up industry jumped on the bandwagon. The newest generation of beauty products will be personalised to meet all your particular needs - from bespoke mascaras and eyeliners to foundations and powders unique to you. Scroll down for video . The newest generation of beauty products will be personalised to meet all your particular needs . Eyeko London's Bespoke Mascara (£28) comes in dozens of brush shapes . Eyeko London is just one brand taking advantage of the trend with the launch of its new Bespoke Mascara (£28), offering more than 100 different combinations of brush shape and formula to suit your lashes. At Eyeko's Bespoke Eye Wardrobe in London's Harvey Nichols, which launched earlier this month, customers can choose between dozens of brush shapes - from thick wands for a dramatic Sixties look to skinnier ones for lengthened, separated lashes. The mascaras, containing natural ingredients like conditioning shea butter and hydrating keratin, are created on site and then wrapped in monogrammed packaging to complete the personalised theme. Co-founder Nina Leykind said: 'It's like the Baskin Robbins of mascara. Getting it right is about the combination. One doesn’t work without the other. 'Even if you have an amazing brush for you, if it’s put together with the wrong formula then it doesn’t work.' Foundation, too, is set to see a surge in personalisation. Beauty brands have long promised customised foundation, but finding that perfect shade and texture is easier said than done. Enter Cover FX Custom Cover Drops (£36) a new game-changing alternative to foundation which can transform your entire make-up collection. Cover Drops, which are based on a colour palette of neutral, pink and gold, can be mixed with any of your favourite moisturisers, oils, serums or other foundations to create your preferred texture and finish. Using 'Flash Fusion' technology, as soon as the drops are added to a beauty product, they blend in flawlessly, leaving behind only pure pigments and instant tint. Cover FX Custom Cover Drops (£36) can be mixed with any of your favourite moisturizers, oils, serums or other foundations to create your preferred texture and finish . It's not just make-up that is increasingly becoming tailored to your personal needs. Skincare brand Jennifer Young offers customised moisturisers, serums, cleansers and toners made with the particular ingredients that your skin craves. Customers who visit the Jennifer Young website specify their gender, age, problem areas, preferred scent and skin sensitivities, among other options. They are then presented with a selection of made-to-order products designed to enhance their particular skin type, with prices starting at £20 for a custom-made toner. Not only are beauty brands creating more and more customised products, but shops and department stores are also taking note of the bespoke trend by launching services to help customers create their own blends. Harvey Nichols' newly-launched Beauty Concierge (pictured) is  a personal shopping service  for make-up . Harvey Nichols' newly-launched Beauty Concierge, for instance, is like a personal shopping service specifically for make-up. Customers who book a complimentary appointment meet with a Beauty Adviser, whose mission it is to seek out your ideal lipstick, fragrance or skincare, with no bias towards particular brands. According to Daniela Rinaldi, group beauty buying director at Harvey Nichols, bespoke products are most certainly the future of beauty - and customisation is only going to get bigger. 'I think the one size fits all concept just simply doesn’t cater to customers’ individual needs at all times anymore,' she explained. 'Whilst there is still definitely a market for ready-to-wear beauty, we are seeing an increase in our customers wanting to know that the product they are using is right for them; many don’t want to learn this through a process of trial and error.'",

    "source": "Apple has revealed it will only accept online orders for its much-anticipated watch which goes on sale on the 24th April. The firm will show off the watch to the public for the first time from tomorrow at its retail stores and several special popup stores around the world. From tomorrow morning, customers will be able to preorder their watch online. Scroll down for video . Apple Watch, available for pre-order on Friday, April 10, 2015, comes with a choice of watch case, band and size _ there are 54 possible configurations in all. If you know the specific configuration you want, you're best off ordering it online, starting at 12:01 a.m. PDT Friday (3:01 a.m. EDT). They will start to ship on April 24. Popular models might not be available right away if you're not among the first to order. Your watch will get shipped to you. There won't be an in-store pick-up option. 'We are excited to welcome customers tomorrow and introduce them to Apple Watch, our most personal device yet.said Angela Ahrendts, Apple's senior vice president of Retail and Online Stores. 'Based on the tremendous interest from people visiting our stores, as well as the number of customers who have gone to the Apple Online Store to mark their favourite Apple Watch ahead of availability, we expect that strong customer demand will exceed our supply at launch,' 'To provide the best experience and selection to as many customers as we can, we will be taking orders for Apple Watch exclusively online during the initial launch period.' Customers in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, the UK and the US can try on and experience Apple Watch at their local Apple Store or at Galeries Lafayette in Paris, Isetan in Tokyo, Selfridges in London, and select Apple Authorised Resellers in Japan and China. Customers can pre-order their Apple Watch through the Apple Online Store beginning April 10 at 8:01 a.m. BST for delivery beginning April 24. In stores, customers will get a personalised session with a Specialist to try on, fit and size their band, and explore the amazing features of Apple Watch. Apple says it encourages customers who want to try on an Apple Watch are encouraged to make an appointment online at www.apple.com. Pre-orders begin April 10 at 8:01 a.m. BST through the Apple Online Store and the Apple Store app for iPhone and iPad. Customers who pre-order their Apple Watch can have it shipped for delivery beginning April 24. The watch, when paired with an iPhone, allows users to check email, listen to music and make phone calls. 'Will the Apple Watch change your life? Well, possibly more than many realise until they start using it. 'After a day or two with the watch, a strange thing happened - I completely stopped checking my phone. 'While Apple may be the firm that really creates phone addiction, meaning we are constantly checking our handsets, with the Apple Watch it may have cured it. 'Apple undoubtedly has another hit on its hands with the watch. 'As more and more apps appear, and developers actually get to spend time with it, I fully expect it be used in ways we can’t even imagine now. 'Much like the iPhone, apps could propel this to become a new computing platform - and even with the features it already has, the Apple watch is the most elegant way to communicate digitally.' 'Starting Friday, customers can try on Apple Watch, Apple Watch Sport or Apple Watch Edition to find the model with the size, finish and band to best fit their personal preference and style,' the firm explained. 'Everyone visiting an Apple Store will be able to view all three collections and get hands on with Apple Watch Demo to browse and edit different watch faces, and learn about Apple Watch's health and fitness features, Digital Touch, Siri and more.' Based on a survey in the United States on consumer interest in buying the Apple Watch, BMO Capital Markets has cut its estimate for sales to 39 million units though September 2016. Previously, the analysts had estimated sales of 55.5 million units. About 735 people responded to the survey. Apple is among several companies, including Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Sony Corp, that are jumping into the nascent market for wearable devices. The watch, when paired with an iPhone, allows users to check email, listen to music and make phone calls. Faces on the watch can be customised, and users will be shown this in strore . There is also an app that helps people monitor their health, for example by tracking heartbeats and footsteps. 'We believe in the next five years, the watch will revolutionize the way we interact with objects around us,' Oppenheimer analysts wrote a note on Thursday. Apple shares were up 0.3 percent at $125.98 in early trading on Thursday. Each version of the watch will come in different colour options. Apple's Watch goes on display around the world on 10 April and people can pre-order it at 12.01 Pacific Time (8am BST) on this day. The Watch will then go on general sale on 24 April in the US, UK, Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong and Japan . Apple Watch comes with a choice of watch case, band and size — there are 54 possible configurations in all. Most models come in two sizes, 38 millimeters and 42 millimeters, as measured by the height of the watch face. The larger one costs $50 more in most cases. For a few of the bands, only one size is available. There are three lines to choose from: . The sport, Watch and Edition versions of the smart timepiece . The cheapest is a 'Sport' version with an aluminum case. You can get it with a silver case and choose a white, blue, green or pink band made of synthetic rubber. Or get a grey case with a black band. The smaller version costs $349, and the large one is $399. That's 10 configurations — five bands, each in two sizes. The regular version has a stainless steel case. The cheapest has the same band as the Sport version. You choose white or black and pay $549 for the smaller model and $599 for large. Fancier bands are available — three different leather bands, a link bracelet or a Milanese loop. Prices go as high as $1,099 for a large watch with a stainless steel link bracelet. There are 20 official configurations, but once you factor in some leather bands coming in two or three sizes, you have 32 options to choose from. Edition is the luxury line with cases made of 18-karat gold alloy. It's $10,000 for a small version with the white or black band that comes with Sport models. The large one costs $12,000. You can get a leather band for $15,000 or $17,000, depending on the size. There are officially eight luxury configurations, or 12 if you count band sizes as choices. Apple is also selling bands separately for those who like to swap designs. Prices range from $49 for the basic sport band to $449 for a link bracelet. To help you choose, Apple has plenty of videos on its website and Apple Store and Apple Watch apps. The Apple Store app also has sizing guides, images of the watch cases in actual size and animation of buckles and clasps, which you can open and close by pinching in and out.",

Thanks to these benefits, mahonia has been used traditionally for skin itchiness, infections and irritations, and is highly recommended for acne.

Antimicrobial herb calendula is rich in anti-ageing antioxidant beta-carotene, which is important for healthy skin structure and renewal. Also known as magnolia vine, schisandra has been used historically for immune support and for skin care. Modern Chinese research suggests it has a protective effect on the liver, so enhancing the cleansing benefits. The succulent globe artichoke, meanwhile, has been used in Chinese medicine for millennia as a digestive cleanser. It helps to purify and calm the system from within.

    "source": "Fireman Stephen Hunt, 38, died after he and a colleague got into difficulties battling a fire started at Paul's Hair World in Manchester's Northern Quarter on July 13, 2013 . A 16-year-old girl charged with arson after she discarded a cigarette causing a city centre shop blaze which claimed the life of a firefighter had the charge dropped today after a judge said she was 'guilty only of being careless'. Fireman Stephen Hunt, 38, lost his life tackling the inferno which began at Paul's Hair World in Manchester's Northern Quarter almost two years ago. The girl - who was just 15 at the time - is said to have dropped a cigarette to the floor while standing near the shop's fire exit which rolled underneath the door and set boxes alight. She was originally charged with arson being reckless as to whether life was endangered, but was cleared having been due to stand trial on Monday. After more than a year of legal wrangling, with scientists initially stating that the fire could not have been started accidentally, further investigation led to the conclusion a discarded cigarette could have been the cause. More than 60 firefighters battled the blaze, which erupted on July 13, 2013, as frightened passers-by watched on. Father-of-two Mr Hunt, of Whitefield, Manchester, and another fireman, got into difficulties while tackling the fire and they were rushed to hospital where Mr Hunt was pronounced dead. At Manchester Crown Court, prosecutor Alexander Leach said thin and damaged cardboard boxes and paper labels stored behind the fire door at the business may well have caught fire if a cigarette was discarded. He said: 'Combined with the suggestion that boxes may have been on top of the smouldering cigarette, compressing and containing the heat, this made it more likely items would ignite. The salon was totally gutted when an inferno started by a discarded cigarette ripped through it. The 16-year-old girl who started the fire was today told she will not face trial for arson as she had only been 'careless' The family of Stephen Hunt visit the scene where he died. The girl who started the fire is said to have dropped a cigarette while standing near the shop's fire exit which rolled underneath the door and set boxes alight . Firefighters enter the remains of music venue NQ Live in Manchester which was also destroyed by the fire (left). Dozens of floral tributes to fireman Stephen Hunt were left at the scene (right) 'It was a hot day and there was a gap beneath the door and as a result experts were unable to exclude a chimney effect as air was drawn under the gap underneath the door and the fire began. 'The conclusion is the Crown's case, which had previously been based on scientific evidence which excluded accidental ignition, can no longer be sustained, so I offer no evidence.' The teenager, who did not attend court, was initially arrested along with another 15-year-old girl but she was the only one charged. Throwing the case out, Judge Michael Henshell said: 'I spent some time reading the papers and reports and it is perfectly obvious this terrible and tragic case demonstrates the danger and potential danger from discarded cigarettes. A fireman patrols the scene in Manchester's Northern Quarter where his colleague was killed. More than 1,000 firefighters, emergency service staff and members of the public lined the streets of Bury for Mr Hunt's funeral . More than 60 firefighters battled the blaze, which erupted on July 13, 2013, as passers-by watched on . 'This was discarded without any thought and as a result a fire started in circumstances which were particular to the site in question, resulting in extensive damage and costing the life of a man who, as part of his employment, was there to protect life and property. 'It was a terrible consequence for a thoughtless act. The girl who had been charged and faced trial was, in fact, blameless so far as criminal law is concerned and guilty only of being careless.' In September 2013 more than 1,000 firefighters, emergency service staff and members of the public lined the streets of Bury for Mr Hunt's funeral. In a tribute to him at his funeral, his son Sam said: 'To me, he wasn't just my dad but my hero, my role model and my best friend.' Following the hearing today, a spokesperson for Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said: 'We have made no comment on any aspect of the incident and are unlikely to do so until the coroner's inquest into Stephen's death has concluded. 'Safe to say we continue to work with everyone involved in various investigations to find the truth of what happened, not least for Stephen's family but for everyone involved and especially our firefighters.'",

After more than a year of legal wrangling, with scientists initially stating that the fire could not have been started accidentally, further investigation led to the conclusion a discarded cigarette could have been the cause. At Manchester Crown Court, prosecutor Alexander Leach said thin and damaged cardboard boxes and paper labels stored behind the fire door at the business may well have caught fire if a cigarette was discarded. The teenager, who did not attend court, was initially arrested along with another 15-year-old girl but she was the only one charged. Judge Michael Henshell said: 'It was a terrible consequence for a thoughtless act. The girl who had been charged and faced trial was, in fact, blameless so far as criminal law is concerned and guilty only of being careless.'",

    "source": "Mario Balotelli revealed his delight on Twitter after Manchester City forward Sergio Aguero struck early on against Manchester United, even though City's eventual defeat was good news for Liverpool. Argentine striker Aguero opened the scoring after eight minutes at Old Trafford, and his controversial former City team-mate took the opportunity to lay into his biggest rivals from his time at the Etihad Stadium and at Anfield. Balotelli tweeted: 'Yeeeees city @aguerosergiokun !!! 1-0 OLD TRAFFORD...Stand up and shut up.' Mario Balotelli revealed his delight on Twitter after Manchester City scored early on in the Manchester derby . Balotelli tweeted: 'Yeeeees city @aguerosergiokun !!! 1-0 OLD TRAFFORD...Stand up and shut up.' Sergio Aguero struck after eight minutes to give City the lead but they were blitzed by United in a 4-2 loss . Despite Balotelli's gloating, the defeat for City is actually more beneficial to his Liverpool side . While United's blitz of City went on to leave the Italian red-faced anyway, the fact that a defeat for the champions was beneficial for his current club will not have gone unnoticed either. Instead, Balotelli seemed to throw his weight behind his former employers rather than clinging on to Liverpool's slim hopes of Champions League qualification that look like they will only open up if City's slump continues. Liverpool - and Balotelli - face Newcastle United on Monday night with the chance of closing the gap on City in fourth to four points in the Barclays Premier League. Controversial striker Balotelli listens in as Brendan Rodgers talks his team through a training session . Balotelli and his Liverpool team-mates face Newcastle United on Monday clinging to their top four hopes . And with Manuel Pellegrini's side having lost six of their last eight in all competitions the Anfield club maintain a small chance of taking a top four place, even if it isn't at the top of Balotelli's list of priorities. The 24-year-old has had his run-ins with the red half of Manchester before, famously celebrating a goal with his 'Why always me' shirt at Old Trafford in 2011 and clashing with Rio Ferdinand after a win over United at Wembley in the same year.",

    "generated": "• Sergio Aguero scored early for Manchester City at Old Trafford, prompting former City striker Mario Balotelli to taunt Manchester United on Twitter - though City would ultimately lose the match\n\n• The City defeat could benefit Liverpool's Champions League hopes, with the Reds able to close gap to just 4 points behind struggling City (who have lost 6 of their last 8 games)\n\n• Balotelli's support of City comes despite currently playing for Liverpool, creating an awkward situation given Liverpool's chase for City's Champions League spot\n\n• The Italian striker has history of provocative behavior against Manchester United, most famously wearing a 'Why always me?' shirt while celebrating at Old Trafford in 2011\n\n• He was also involved in a notable altercation with United's Rio Ferdinand at Wembley that same year",

But after 15 blissful years skipping over legal hurdles, it all came to a grinding halt when she was stopped for a traffic violation. Police started to investigate Parker after realizing she gave the traffic officers a false name. Tracking down her house, they found she was leasing under another false name. The case quickly unraveled into one of the biggest cases of identity theft the state has ever seen. Master con? Cathryn Parker, 72, has been living as 74 different people, mainly Hollywood production staffers . 'I've been a cop for 20 years... and this is the first case where I've had this many aliases,' LAPD's Detective Danny Gore told the LA Times. He predicted Parker would have continued to operate under the various identities for the rest of her life. 'It's like a way of life. I don't know that there was an end,' he remarked. 'You have to be dedicated.' Efforts to find a phone number for Parker were unsuccessful. It wasn't immediately known if she has an attorney. As of Friday, Parker was in federal custody in Northern California, where she was wanted for probation violations. She was convicted in 2000 for federal mail fraud in Hawaii after she used the Jenny Craig Corp's corporate travel account to purchase plane tickets and then sold the tickets privately for $500 apiece. Parker has repeatedly violated the terms of her release since then and was wanted by the U.S. Marshals, according to records. According to police, she also paid utilities under false names and acquired credit cards with other people's financial information. After she serves time in Northern California, she'll be sent down to Los Angeles County to answer for the alleged identity thefts, Deputy U.S. Marshal Laura Vega said. Until that time, investigators are looking for more victims. Though the current victims only date back to 2012, Gore said he believes there could be incidents going back to 2010.

The incident is difficult to comprehend as the collision was much more than just a minor skirmish on the tarmac at the busy Asian airport. The damage on the vehicle is clear, although it is unknown if the engine of the Boeing 777 jet was damaged or if anyone was injured. The bus ploughed into the engine of the Uzbekistan Airways Boeing 777 passenger jet . Tashkent is the largest international airport in Uzbekistan, and the busiest in Central Asia, so the crash will have more than likely delayed many passengers. The plane was believed to be an Uzbekistan Airways service, the national airline of the country, with its headquarters at Tashkent. MailOnline Travel has contacted Uzbekistan Airways and is awaiting comment. This kind of incident is unfortunately becoming more common. Ryanair passengers travelling to Edinburgh and Zadar, Croatia were delayed for hours after two of the budget airline’s planes clipped wings at Dublin Airport back on April 1. Photos snapped by travellers show the tip of a winglet dangling by a thread after clipping the other plane - and it's the second time in six months two Ryanair planes have collided at Ireland's busiest airport. It's difficult to comprehend the moments leading up the crash as the force of impact is severe . Passengers escaped injury when the planes collided as they taxied to a runway shortly before 8am, but the incident caused disruption for hundreds of travellers. In October 2014 a Ryanair jet had its winglet torn off when it collided with another plane belonging to the budget carrier at Dublin Airport. The Boeing 737s heading to Edinburgh and Brussels were taxiing to a runway when they collided in darkness. In January this year a British Airways plane hit a hangar at Heathrow Airport, while being towed away for routine maintenance. As the Boeing 777-200 aircraft was being towed towards a hangar, someone misjudged the distance and the plane's wing clipped the wall of a nearby building. There were no injuries from the collision, and the airport and airline continued to operate normally for the rest of the day.",

Tashkent is the largest international airport in Uzbekistan, and the busiest in Central Asia, so the crash will have more than likely delayed many passengers. The plane was believed to be an Uzbekistan Airways service, the national airline of the country, with its headquarters at Tashkent.

    "source": "(CNN)Pop star Taylor Swift, who has built an intense bond with her fans by sharing personal details of her life, revealed some sobering news Thursday: Her mother has cancer. The singer did not divulge the nature or severity of the cancer, saying \"I'd like to keep the details of her condition and treatment plans private.\" Andrea Swift, 57, who years ago quit her job as a mutual fund marketing executive to raise Swift and Swift's younger brother, Austin, has joined her famous daughter on tour and in several of her videos. In a post on Tumblr, the blogging platform, Swift said that for Christmas last year, she asked her mom to get screened for potential health issues, \"just to ease some worries of mine.\" Her mother felt \"perfectly fine\" but went to the doctor for tests anyway \"just to get me and my brother off her case\" about it. \"The results came in, and I'm saddened to tell you that my mom has been diagnosed with cancer. I'd like to keep the details of her condition and treatment plans private, but she wanted you to know,\" Swift added. #PrayForMamaSwift was a trending hashtag Thursday on Twitter, where Swift's legions of fans offered prayers and messages of support. Within an hour and a half, Swift's tweet about her mom had been retweeted more than 21,000 times. Many fans shared \"there's something in your eyes that says we can beat this,\" a lyric from Swift's 2008 song \"Change.\" Swift also urged her fans to make sure their parents get screened for cancer and other potential health problems. \"She wanted you to know because your parents may be too busy juggling everything they've got going on to go to the doctor, and maybe you reminding them to go get checked for cancer could possibly lead to an early diagnosis and an easier battle ...\" she wrote. \"Or peace of mind in knowing that they're healthy and there's nothing to worry about.\" Swift, 25, added that \"usually when things happen to me, I process them and then write music about how I feel, and you hear it much later. This is something my family and I thought you should know about now. \"Thank you for caring about my family so much that she would want me to share this information with you. I hope and pray that you never get news like this.\" Andrea Swift and Swift's father, Scott Kingsley Swift, live in Nashville, Tennessee, in a mansion bought by their daughter in 2011 for $2.5 million.",

In a post on Tumblr, the blogging platform, Swift said that for Christmas last year, she asked her mom to get screened for potential health issues, \"just to ease some worries of mine.\" Her mother felt \"perfectly fine\" but went to the doctor for tests anyway \"just to get me and my brother off her case\" about it.",

    "source": "Rangers kept the pressure on Hibernian in the race for second spot in the Championship with a comfortable 4-0 win over Raith Rovers. Hibs had secured a win over Hearts in the Edinburgh derby in the earlier kick-off and the Light Blues knew they had to respond. They bounced back from Thursday's defeat by Queen of the South, with Nicky Clark and Haris Vuckic claiming a goal apiece and Nicky Law grabbing a double. Nicky Clark celebrates after putting Rangers 1-0 up against Raith Rovers on Sunday . Clark in the air as he heads the ball towards goal to give the hosts the lead at Ibrox . Rangers manager Stuart McCall applauds the home fans after the full-time whistle . The win means Rangers and Hibs remain level on 61 points, albeit the Leith side have the better goal difference. Stuart McCall had suffered his first defeat as Rangers manager against Queens last week. So it was no real surprise to see him make three changes for the visit of Raith. Goalkeeper Cammy Bell was back between the sticks and Dean Shiels and Robbie Crawford were also added to the side. The Light Blues enjoyed the best possible start to the game when they surged into the lead after just six minutes. Clark found himself in plenty of space to connect with Law's corner and bullet a header home from 10 yards. Law then carved out a chance of his own but his shot from just inside the box was weak and easily held by Kevin Cuthbert. But the goalkeeper had no chance when Gers claimed their second of the day after 27 minutes. Vuckic cut inside from the right before unleashing a powerful drive into the bottom corner to claim his seventh Rangers goal. Haris Vuckic (left) fires the ball home to put Rangers 2-0 ahead against Raith Rovers . Vuckic (left) celebrates his Ibrox goal with team-mate Kenny Miller . Nicky Law slots it home to get the first of his two goals for Rangers on Sunday afternoon . Law (right) wheels away as he celebrates his goal for the home side . Raith could have pulled a goal back moments later but a well-struck free-kick from Ryan Conroy on the edge of the box was blocked by Bell. The visitors fired out another warning to Rangers shortly after the restart. Lewis Vaughan tried his luck with a snap-shot that fell inches past the upright as Raith tried to haul themselves back into the game. At the other end, the hosts passed up a decent chance to all but secure the three points. Vuckic released Crawford and he tried to tee up the shot for Law but he failed to connect in front of goal and the chance was lost. However Law was celebrating when he added his name to the scoresheet after 72 minutes, putting the game beyond Raith. Law's first attempt crashed off the crossbar but the ball fell kindly to his feet and he had the net bulging with the rebound from eight yards. Tom Walsh then saw a terrific volley saved well by the goalkeeper, before Law completed his double when he curled home from the edge of the box with two minutes to go. Law (left) strikes the ball towards goal as he scores Rangers' fourth goal of the afternoon . Law (left) is congratulated by his Rangers team-mates on his Sunday afternoon double . Former Rangers striker Michael Mols was among those in the directors' box at Ibrox on Sunday .",

    "source": "Margaret Gretton has been banned from classrooms for labelling an Asian job applicant 'Taliban' and calling special needs pupils 'roadkill' A primary school headteacher has been banned from classrooms for labelling an Asian job applicant 'Taliban' after referring to special needs pupils as 'roadkill'. Margaret Gretton, 46, has been barred indefinitely from the profession after she referred to the applicant as a member of the terror group and talked of 'bombs and blowing up the school' in an Asian accent. A disciplinary panel of the National College for Teaching and Leadership in Coventry ruled Ms Gretton 'exhibited clear intolerance on the grounds of race, as well as disability'. The panel said she showed no remorse for 'deliberate' and 'repeated' actions while head of Burton Joyce Primary School in Nottingham. They heard that she had mocked special needs students by referring to them as 'cuckoo' and said she didn't want to encourage children 'like that' to come to the school. She even displayed a Golly magnet in her office and made 'monkey noises' on one occasion when talking about black people. Her shocking behaviour continued over a 'sustained period of time' while she was headteacher of the school from September 2007 until November 2013. The panel concluded Ms Gretton 'displayed racist attitudes and behaviour in that - on one or more occasions you inappropriately commented in relation to a photograph of a male Asian job applicant.' It said her comments included 'would you hire me…I'm in the Taliban', or words to that effect, referring to the man as 'Mohammed', or words to that effect, and referring to 'bombs and blowing up the school', or words to that effect, in an Asian accent. A teacher at the school, named only as Staff Member E, told the panel that Ms Gretton said to her, unprompted: 'Do you like black men?' The teacher said she was 'taken aback' by the question, but added that it did not bother her, and her mother's partner was black and from Jamaica. She told the panel that Ms Gretton then 'burst out laughing and said words to the effect of 'does he have big lips?...does he look like a monkey?' and then went on to make monkey noises.' The headteacher denied making the comments, but the panel said it was 'satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the comments, or words similar to them, were made by Ms Gretton. ' The panel also found that she 'expressed inappropriate and discriminatory attitudes towards SEN [Special Educational Needs] pupils in the presence of school staff.' The panel said 'exhibited clear intolerance on the grounds of race, as well as disability' while head of Burton Joyce Primary School in Nottingham (pictured) They said she had used the word 'cuckoo' or words to that affect and said 'we don't want to encourage children like that to come here.' She was also found to have 'deliberately tried to upset' a special needs pupil, 'frightened him', and 'tried to make him cry.' Witness G gave evidence to the panel that on one occasion in 2010 a pupil would not come out from underneath a table and was disrupting the lesson so, as a teaching assistant, she asked Ms Gretton for assistance. She told the panel that 'Ms Gretton said 'It's like something from One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest' and said 'cuckoo, cuckoo' whilst twirling her finger at the side of her head.' A Special Education Needs co-ordinator, who also gave evidence to the panel, said that during a discussion in 2010 about creating a disabled parking space at the school car park she mentioned that Ms Gretton's parking space was the obvious place to put it. However she said that Ms Gretton said: 'We don't want to encourage people like that here.' Ms Gretton was also found to have bullied members of staff which the panel described as 'wholly unacceptable.' It concluded: 'The panel considered that Ms Gretton was not acting under duress, she lacked any insight into her behaviour and demonstrated no remorse. Her shocking behaviour continued over a 'sustained period of time' while she was headteacher of the school (pictured)  from September 2007 until November 2013 . 'Her actions towards staff and pupils were deliberate, repeated and over a sustained period of time. Ms Gretton seriously abused her position of power and trust within the school. ' After the panel made its recommendations Paul Heathcote, acting on behalf of the Secretary of State, decided to prohibit Ms Gretton from teaching indefinitely. He said: 'This is a case where the teacher has exhibited clear intolerance on the grounds of race, as well as disability.' He added: 'There has been no effort made by Ms Gretton to remedy the attitudinal deficiencies which have led her to behave in the way in which she did.' Describing his decision to prohibit the woman from teaching he said: ' This means that Ms Margaret Leandra Gretton is prohibited from teaching indefinitely and cannot teach in any school, sixth form college, relevant youth accommodation or children's home in England. 'Furthermore, in view of the seriousness of the allegations found proved against her, I have decided that Ms Margaret Leandra Gretton shall not be entitled to apply for restoration of her eligibility to teach.' Ms Gretton has right of appeal to the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court, until 28 days after she was given notice of the order.",

    "source": "From the dry, relentless heat of Alice Springs to the icy cold hills of Canberra, a university student will push his body to the limit, running a marathon in each of Australia’s eight states and territories to honour the memory of his late, treasured childhood friend. Although he had never run a marathon before, Callum Ryan, 21, committed himself to the daunting challenge of running eight of them between January and September 2015 - covering a total distance of 337.5 kilometres. His ‘Eight Great States’ campaign is driven by his passion to make a difference after the loss of his friend, Malachy Frawley who died from heart disease in 2013 when he was just 14 years old. Callum is preparing to battle vastly different weather conditions and diverse terrains as he pounds the pavement right around Australia, raising funds for not-for-profit organisation HeartKids Australia - supporting thousands of children living with heart defects. Callum posing like international running champion Usain Bolt at the finish line after the Canberra Times Marathon on April 12, with his little sister Josie and brother Henrik . Callum Ryan poses with his treasured friend Malachy Frawley, who sadly passed away when he was 14 . Malachy Frawley brought laughter to the world in his short but wonderful life, showing great courage through his lifelong battle with the severe heart condition Hypoplastic Right Heart Syndrome . The University of Sydney student has committed himself to the incredible endeavour in memory of a Malachy, who brought laughter to the world in his short but wonderful life, showing great courage through his lifelong battle with the severe heart condition Hypoplastic Right Heart Syndrome. Callum is inspired by the incredible strength and resilience Malachy displayed as he faced the challenges of a Congenital Heart Disease, which severely affected his mobility. Since January, Callum has already faced his first three marathons: kicking it all off with a 22 degree race in Hobart, sweating through the 28 degree heat in the Victoria town of Wangaratta and freezing through an icy seven degree start in Canberra. With each race, Callum has improved on his previous time by at least ten minutes. This comes despite his muscle fatigue with the quick turnaround as he pushes his body to recover and do it all again! The worst is yet to come, as Callum is scheduled to run a marathon in Darwin and then summon the strength to run another in Perth just 14 days later - and another 21 days after that in Sydney. Despite Malachy being five years Callum's junior, they forged a truly special friendship . 'Finished first! (out of all the people running to raise money for HeartKids obviously)' Callum joked after he finishing the Wangaratta marathon in sweltering, 35 degree heat . Eight Great States: One man, eight marathons, eight states and territories, nine months, 337.56 kilometres . Every step of the way, the memory of Malachy is never far from Callum's mind – helping him to find the mental strength to make it to the finish line. ‘At times during the race I thought “it’d be easier to stop now, no one would think any worse of you because a marathon is a tough thing to try”,' Callum said. ‘But I set out to do this. As I run, I sometimes think of Malachy and the thousands and thousands of other kids in that situation.' 'While I was running I thought about kids with Congenital Heart Disease and their families.' Callum is conscious of how lucky he is to be healthy and able to complete a marathon. Every step of the way, the memory of Malachy is never far from Callum's mind – helping him to find the mental strength to make it to the finish line . Malachy was the beloved younger brother of Niamh, Imogen and Seamus, growing up in NSW's Nowra . HeartKids made incredible changes to Malachy's life (pictured with his father Dom and mother Maggie). They supplied him with a segway so he could be more mobile and have his own independence . Hobart was the perfect location for Callum to embark on his first ever marathon - an ideal 22 degrees . ‘Children with CHD struggle to walk around in their day to day lives because their bodies aren't equipped. ‘I had to stick to my challenge because they find that strength every day.’ ‘I disappeared into those types of thoughts and the kilometres fell away.’ ‘With the personal connection none of it feels like a chore or a risk.’ He hopes to make people aware of the plight of children with heart disease and the need to support the children and their families. Every day in Australia, eight babies are born with a heart defect. Every week, four precious lives are lost and vital research needs to take place to work out of how to save them. ‘‘I first came across HeartKids through Malachy. I’d raised money for them before but I wanted to do something significant for Heartkids.’ Every day in Australia, eight babies are born with a heart defect. Every week, four precious lives are lost and vital research needs to take place to work out of how to save them . When Malachy (left) was in kindergarten the pair were excited to discover Callum (right) had also been allocated as Malachy’s Year Six buddy – a mentor and friendly face across the playground . Callum grew up in Nowra in New South Wales’ South Coast, where he formed a close bond with Malachy Frawley (second from left, with his siblings), a family friend five years his junior . ‘The most frightening thing about CHD is that there is no cure at the moment. If you’re born with it, then it’s with you for life. Lives are sadly cut short by it.’ Callum grew up in Nowra in New South Wales’ South Coast, where he formed a close bond with Malachy Frawley, a family friend five years his junior. When Malachy was in kindergarten the pair were excited to discover Callum had also been allocated as Malachy’s Year Six buddy – a mentor and friendly face across the playground. Despite Malachy being five years his junior, they forged a truly special friendship. ‘They had a very lovely friendship. They had the chance to get to know each other despite being five years apart,’ explained Malachy’s father, Dr Dom Frawley. ‘Lucky enough for Callum and Malachy they were paired up and their personalities really gelled. Although he had never run a marathon before, Callum Ryan, 21, committed himself to the daunting challenge of running eight of them between January and September 2015 . Since January, Callum has already faced his first three marathons: including sweating through the 28 degree heat in the Victoria town of Wangaratta (r) and freezing through a seven degree start in Canberra (l) ‘Malachy looked up to Callum a lot as a mentor and Callum took that role seriously and invested a lot of time in Malachy. ‘They got the chance to discover they had a lot in common in the way they saw and thought about things, particularly in the way they were so creative.’ In his fourteen short years, Malachy left his mark on the world – creating, daydreaming and making people smile. Malachy has been remembered as ‘an author, film director, comedian, drummer, raconteur and HeartKids.’ He was adored for his ‘wit and loving nature.’ Malachy was affected by one of the most serious heart conditions, which greatly affected his mobility. Although Callum will be travelling to many marathons alone during his Eight States campaign, he travelled via Camry with his great mate Nick Peters to his third marathon in the ACT . Dom and his family have been greatly touched by Callum’s (third from left) commitment to making a change in the life of other children . He had needed to rely on others to drive or piggyback up from place to place, until HeartKids gifted him with a Segway. ‘The Segway completely transformed his life,’ said his father Dom. ‘He could suddenly get places without having to rely on people to carry him, which was quite a dramatic change from what he’d always been able to do.’ Their boy with a quick wit and limitless imagination now had the freedom of movement and increased independence, able to travel around his neighbourhood and to and from school. ‘I left the training a bit late before my first marathon, frankly. I felt really nervous before my first marathon, thinking “have I done enough?”’. Dom and his family have been greatly touched by Callum’s commitment to making a change in the life of other children. ‘We’re very gratified and we’re touched by it. Hopefully it will help a lot of people with the sickness to raise funds and awareness. ‘It’s great for him to have that awareness. Callum cares a lot about people.’ You can donate to Callum's Eight Great States campaign to help HeartKids here . Callum is preparing to battle vastly different weather conditions and diverse terrains as he pounds the pavement right around Australia, raising funds for not-for-profit organisation HeartKids Australia - supporting thousands of children living with heart defects .",

    "source": "STYLE OVER SUBSTANCE . This game is being billed as Beauty v the Beast, but don’t underestimate Arsene Wenger. It’s not just about style — he plays to win. The philosophy Wenger has imposed has made Arsenal popular throughout the world. People love to watch them, certainly more than Jose Mourinho’s teams. But on Sunday, he is up against the ultimate pragmatist — Mourinho finds any way to win. Chelsea have conceded just two goals in their last six clashes with Arsenal, keeping four clean sheets in the process. Mourinho does exactly what’s necessary. So while Wenger always aims to win, he still cares about the brand of football played. Mourinho’s brand is winning. Arsene Wenger (left) pushed Jose Mourinho when Chelsea beat Arsenal 6-0 at Stamford Bridge last season . Wenger can not be underestimated, according to Martin Keown... it's not all about style, he plays to win . TALKING TACTICS . Arsenal should dominate possession while Chelsea are more likely to sit deep and use the electric pace of Eden Hazard and Willian on the break. Chelsea will be very disciplined and in some ways that is a shame because the players aren’t allowed to express themselves as they might. In the reverse fixture in October, Chelsea pressed Arsenal all over and Wenger’s side were stifled — they did not get a shot on target for the first time in a Premier League match since 2003. Jose creates such an intensity and focus that winning becomes a matter of life and death. But Arsenal will send waves of players forward at pace and try to isolate Branislav Ivanovic, Gary Cahill and John Terry, who are not the quickest. Keown (right) and Wenger go back a long way, after Keown's two stints at Arsenal during his career . Chelsea boss Mourinho always finds a way to win and has a brilliant record against Wenger . CHANGE THE RECORD . Mourinho's record over Wenger is remarkable. Not many managers can say they have never lost to Arsene Wenger. Jose feels he knows Wenger’s game and the Arsenal boss can’t surprise him. I’d be amazed if Chelsea go all out to attack, but they will still pack a punch on the break. FLAVOUR OF THE MONTH . Jose wants to win every trophy going but he has a poor record in the Premier League Manager of the Month award. He has only won it three times, the same as Alan Curbishley and one fewer than Joe Kinnear. Wenger has won it 14 times. THE CESC DIFFERENCE . Cesc Fabregas has enjoyed a brilliant season at Chelsea but I don’t think he would have necessarily benefited Arsenal had he joined. That central midfield area is very congested and he would have halted Aaron Ramsey’s progress. But one thing is certain on Sunday — he won’t receive a warm welcome. Mourinho has a poor Premier League Manager of the Month record; he has won as many as Alan Curbishley . Cesc Fabregas has been impressive this season, but he wouldn't necessarily have been as good with Arsenal .",
    "reference": "Chelsea travel to the Emirates to face Arsenal on Sunday afternoon .\nJose Mourinho has an impressive record against Arsene Wenger .\nDespite that, Wenger cannot be underestimated - he plays to win .\nCesc Fabregas has impressed this season, but he would not necessarily have had the same impact if he had joined Arsenal from Barcelona .",
    "generated": "Arsenal vs Chelsea Match Preview Highlights:\n\nManagerial Rivalry:\n• Match presents classic clash between Arsene Wenger's attacking philosophy and Jose Mourinho's pragmatic approach\n• Previous tension between managers led to physical confrontation during Chelsea's 6-0 win over Arsenal\n• Despite fewer Manager of the Month awards (3 vs Wenger's 14), Mourinho holds strong head-to-head record against Wenger\n\nTactical Preview:\n• Arsenal expected to dominate possession with aggressive attacking play\n• Chelsea likely to employ defensive, counter-attacking strategy\n• Arsenal targeting Chelsea's defensive trio (Ivanovic, Cahill, Terry) with pace-based attacks\n\nKey Player Focus:\n• Former Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas, now at Chelsea, faces his old club\n• Fabregas enjoying strong season with Chelsea\n• Expected to receive hostile reception from Arsenal supporters\n\nHistorical Context:\n• Wenger holds impressive 14 Premier League Manager of the Month awards\n• Mourinho's three monthly awards equal Alan Curbishley's total\n• Notable that Joe Kinnear (4) has more monthly awards than Mourinho",

    "source": "For those who like their plot lines thick and brimming with intrigue, steering clear of Paisley last night seemed the judicious option. A Celtic side with the scent of the Treble in their nostrils facing a St Mirren outfit badly in danger of entering free-fall scarcely looked like a recipe for a Friday-night thriller. And yet, for all Ronny Deila’s side prevailed in the end, this scrap provided compelling evidence that they won’t simply be given a free ride towards a fourth successive title in the coming weeks. Celtic winger Kris Commons (right) has a shot on goal during the SPL match against St Mirren on Friday . St Mirren's Jim Goodwin slides in with a challenge on Celtic midfielder Stefan Johansen at St Mirren Park . St Mirren (4-4-2): Ridgers, Naismith, McAusland, Genev, Tesselaar, Goodwin, Dayton (Thompson 78), Mallan (Sonupe 77), McGinn, Sadlier (Morgan 73), Arquin . Subs not used: Kelly, Gow, Reilly, Wilks . Booked: Goodwin, Genev . Celtic (4-4-2): Gordon, Matthews (Ambrose Emuobo 65), Van Dijk, Denayer, Izaguirre, Brown, Johansen, Forrest, Commons (Mackay-Steven 72), Armstrong (Bitton 66), Stokes . Subs not used: Guidetti, Zaluska, Griffiths, McGregor . Scorers: Forrest 64 . Referee: Alan Muir . St Mirren may be at the bottom of the Premiership table and still four points from even a play-off spot but, on this showing, they aren’t out of it yet. They frustrated Celtic for the most part here, their energy and belief taking them so far — but not far enough. James Forrest was the man whose intervention broke Gary Teale’s heart with a second half tap-in while any realistic chance of an unlikely comeback was killed off when Stefan Johansen later converted from the penalty spot. Now eight points clear of Aberdeen, however, Deila’s misgivings about a far from perfect display will be tempered with a realisation that the title is edging ever closer to his grasp. The Celtic boss made four changes from the side which won the last of the four game-series with Dundee United before the international break. St Mirren goalkeeper Mark Ridgers (centre) comes out to punch the ball clear of the head of Jason Denayer . Commons (right) and Ste Mirren's John McGinn (left) tussle for the ball during the SPL match on Friday . St Mirren's Jason Naismtih (right) battles with Stuart Armstrong (left) during the SPL match in Paisley . Out went Efe Ambrose, Nir Bitton, Gary Mackay-Steven and John Guidetti with Adam Matthews, Anthony Stokes, Kris Commons and Forrest the beneficiaries. Surprisingly, given the poverty of his side’s display in the defeat to St Johnstone, Teale made only three alterations with Kieran Sadlier, Marc McAusland and Yoann Arquin restored to the side. St Mirren’s attempts to address the obvious quality gap with guts and industry bore early fruit. With next to no time on the ball, Celtic were unable to find their rhythm let alone a killer pass. Commons, typically, was the man who found the space others couldn’t in order to fashion the first chance. Dropping into a pocket of space behind the Saints defence, he gathered Scott Brown’s incisive pass then shaped as if to cross. His attempt to beat Mark Ridgers at his near post was audacious but unsuccessful as the goalkeeper turned the ball around the post. Now playing without the burden of international football, Commons looked better for the break. When Johansen picked him out 30 yards from goal, he glided away from three challenges before lashing a shot into the side-netting. Largely written off as relegation certainties after their last dire outing in Perth, no one could accuse St Mirren of not giving it their all as they sought to claim an unlikely bonus point to help their plight. Celtic's James Forrest (left) tussles for the ball with St Mirren's Jeroen Tesselaar (right) on Friday night . St Mirren' s Yoann Arquin (left) has a shot at goal but it is saved by Celtic goalkeeper Craig Gordon (centre) Celtic really ought to have taken the lead in 26 minutes. Stuart Armstrong had started the game with a couple of heavy touches but his pass to Commons was perfectly weighted. Commons took one touch to control and a second to blast the ball towards Ridgers’ goal. The keeper blocked smartly, though. St Mirren then finally worried Craig Gordon. Sadlier danced away from Matthews on the flank and found the space between Celtic’s central defenders where Stephen Mallan was lurking. His header floated towards the keeper’s top corner but never with the required velocity to beat him. Ridgers was earning his corn. When Commons turned provider for Forrest, the winger looked to have picked his spot in the bottom corner with a side-foot only for the keeper’s agility to leave the Celtic star with his head buried in his hands. It served to embolden the home side. Armstrong’s tackle on Sadlier inadvertently set up Arquin but the striker seemed spooked by the chance and fired weakly into Gordon’s arms. Deila isn’t renowned for endangering crockery collections at half-time in dressing rooms up and down the land but it can safely be assumed he had a few choice words for a Celtic side that been some way short of sparkling in the first period. Celtic manager Rory Deila (left) gives instructions to his captain Scott Brown (right) against St Mirren . Forrest slides on his knees to celebrate scoring Celtic's opening goal against St Mirren on Friday night . Armstrong’s dipping shot from 20 yards was a yard shy of changing the narrative of the night within 60 seconds of the restart before Stokes’ snap-shot was easily claimed by Ridgers. When Jeroen Tesselaar needlessly conceded a corner, he was grateful to the goalkeeper for punching Jason Denayer’s header off his line. Commons smashed the spoils low into the side-net. Mallan issued a timely reminder that St Mirren were still very much in the game with a strike that had Gordon scrambling. The Saints midfielder sprawled to the turf after a foot sprint with Brown on the counter-attack but ref Alan Muir wasn’t interested. Just as the Buddies looked to have the measure of the league leaders — so much so that Deila was looking to his bench — one moment of slackness cost them dear. Brown was the catalyst with a supreme pass in behind Tesselaar, taking the Dutchman out of the game and holding up perfectly for Matthews. Celtic midfielder Johansen slots home from the penalty spot to secure his side's 2-0 victory at St Mirren . The Welshman’s low cross was accurate and turned home with a flash of Forrest’s boot at the far post — his second goal in three games. With that, Matthews and Armstrong departed to be replaced by Bitton and Ambrose before Mackay-Steven came on for Commons. Saints, to their huge credit, stuck to their task with Jim Goodwin, who had been harshly booked in the first half, seemingly at the heart of everything. Some 11 minutes from time, the result was put beyond all reasonable doubt. Forrest’s shot did strike Viktor Genev on the arm but there seemed a case to be made in mitigation that it was not deliberate. The Bulgarian was booked for squabbling with Muir’s decision but the delay didn’t perturb Johansen who calmly sent Ridgers the wrong way from 12 yards.",

    "source": "(CNN)The abduction of more than 200 schoolgirls a year ago this week captured global attention and inspired the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls, but the horrors for Nigeria's children are widespread. \"Around 800,000 children have been forced to flee their homes as a result of the conflict in northeast Nigeria between Boko Haram, military forces and civilian self-defense groups,\" UNICEF said Monday. The \"number of children running for their lives within Nigeria, or crossing over the border to Chad, Niger and Cameroon, has more than doubled in just less than a year.\" UNICEF released a report on the crisis titled \"Missing Childhoods.\" It also launched a social media campaign using the hashtag #bringbackourchildhood. The campaign has \"leading Snapchat artists\" sharing images based on drawings from children in Nigeria, Chad, Niger and Cameroon.  Artwork can also be seen on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr. More than 1.5 million people have fled their homes due to the violence, UNICEF said. About 1.2 million are displaced internally, while others have crossed into Cameroon, Chad and Niger. \"The vast majority of the displaced -- more than 880,000 -- are staying with host communities with little access to humanitarian support, putting additional strains on already stretched health, education and social services,\" it said. The April 14, 2014, kidnappings at a girls school in Chibok by the Islamist group Boko Haram \"is only one of endless tragedies being replicated on an epic scale across Nigeria and the region,\" said Manuel Fontaine, UNICEF regional director for West and Central Africa. \"Scores of girls and boys have gone missing in Nigeria -- abducted, recruited by armed groups, attacked, used as weapons, or forced to flee violence. They have the right to get their childhoods back.\" Kids are being used by Boko Haram as combatants, cooks, and lookouts, UNICEF said. \"Young women and girls are being subjected to forced marriage, forced labor and rape,\" it said. At least 196 teachers and 314 schoolchildren were killed in 2014, and more than 300 schools were damaged or destroyed.",

The campaign has \"leading Snapchat artists\" sharing images based on drawings from children in Nigeria, Chad, Niger and Cameroon.  Artwork can also be seen on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr. More than 1.5 million people have fled their homes due to the violence, UNICEF said. About 1.2 million are displaced internally, while others have crossed into Cameroon, Chad and Niger. \"The vast majority of the displaced -- more than 880,000 -- are staying with host communities with little access to humanitarian support, putting additional strains on already stretched health, education and social services,\" it said. The April 14, 2014, kidnappings at a girls school in Chibok by the Islamist group Boko Haram \"is only one of endless tragedies being replicated on an epic scale across Nigeria and the region,\" said Manuel Fontaine, UNICEF regional director for West and Central Africa. \"Scores of girls and boys have gone missing in Nigeria -- abducted, recruited by armed groups, attacked, used as weapons, or forced to flee violence. They have the right to get their childhoods back.\" Kids are being used by Boko Haram as combatants, cooks, and lookouts, UNICEF said. \"Young women and girls are being subjected to forced marriage, forced labor and rape,\" it said. At least 196 teachers and 314 schoolchildren were killed in 2014, and more than 300 schools were damaged or destroyed.",

A Turkish court imposed the blocks because images of the deadly siege were being shared on social media and 'deeply upset' the wife and children of Mehmet Selim Kiraz, the hostage who was killed. The 46-year-old Turkish prosecutor died in hospital when members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front (DHKP-C) stormed a courthouse and took him hostage. The DHKP-C is considered a terrorist group by Turkey, the European Union and US. Scroll down for video . A Turkish court has blocked access to Twitter and YouTube after they refused a request to remove pictures of prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz held during an armed siege last week . Grief: The family of Mehmet Selim Kiraz grieve over his coffin during his funeral at Eyup Sultan Mosque in Istanbul, Turkey. He died in hospital after he was taken hostage by the far-left organisation . Two of his captors were killed when security forces took back the building where the far-left group was holding him. Gunshots were heard and smoke could be seen rising from the scene at the end of the six-hour stand-off. Mr Kiraz, a father-of-two married to a judge who also worked at the courthouse, was targeted for his part in an investigation into the death of Berkin Elvan. The 15-year-old was severely wounded after being hit on the head by a tear-gas canister fired by a police officer during anti-government protests in Istanbul in June 2013. After spending 269 days in a coma, Elvan eventually died on March 11 last year. His death, and the subsequent investigation, have since become a rallying point for the country's far-left. Gathering: Prosecutors, lawyers and judges stand near a statue of Lady Justice during the funeral ceremony . A British national, of Polish origin but who has not been named, was arrested on Saturday as part of an operation against the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front, according to reports. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said this morning: 'I can confirm that a British national has been arrested in Turkey and that we are offering consular assistance.' Before imposing the blocks on the websites, Turkish authorities had tried to prevent newspapers printing images taken during the siege last week. The newspapers were accused by the government of 'spreading terrorist propaganda' in sharing the images of the hostage-taking. Presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said: 'This has to do with the publishing of the prosecutor's . picture. What happened in the aftermath (of the prosecutor's . killing) is as grim as the incident itself. 'The demand from the prosecutor's office is that this image . not be used anywhere in electronic platforms. 'The wife and children of prosecutor Kiraz have been deeply . upset. The images are everywhere.' He added: 'A request has been made to both Twitter and YouTube for the . removal of the images and posts but they have not accepted it . and no response has been given. 'That's why . this decision has been taken through a court in Istanbul.' Critical: Prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz was taken to hospital with gunshot wounds but died of his injuries . Strength of feeling: Elvan has since become an icon for the Turkish far-left and his supporters accuse the authorities of covering up the circumstances and perpetrators of his death . Google said it was working to restore service to the YouTube . video-sharing site, which it owns. Twitter also said it was . working to restore access for its users. Facebook said it had complied with a Turkish court order requiring it to restrict access to some content or face a block on its service. A company spokesman said it would appeal the order. Turkey's telecoms regulator could not immediately be reached . and there was no statement on its website. This is not the first time that Turkish authorities have imposed blocks on social media sites and networks. In the run-up to local elections in March 2014 blocks were imposed after recordings circulated allegedly revealing corruption among senior officials. Figures provided by Twitter revealed that Turkey filed more requests to remove content from the social network than any other nation between July and December 2014.",

            "original_content": "Turkey has blocked access to Twitter and YouTube after they refused a request to remove pictures of a prosecutor held during an armed siege last week. A Turkish court imposed the blocks because images of the deadly siege were being shared on social media and 'deeply upset' the wife and children of Mehmet Selim Kiraz, the hostage who was killed. The 46-year-old Turkish prosecutor died in hospital when members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front (DHKP-C) stormed a courthouse and took him hostage. The DHKP-C is considered a terrorist group by Turkey, the European Union and US. Scroll down for video . A Turkish court has blocked access to Twitter and YouTube after they refused a request to remove pictures of prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz held during an armed siege last week . Grief: The family of Mehmet Selim Kiraz grieve over his coffin during his funeral at Eyup Sultan Mosque in Istanbul, Turkey. He died in hospital after he was taken hostage by the far-left organisation . Two of his captors were killed when security forces took back the building where the far-left group was holding him. Gunshots were heard and smoke could be seen rising from the scene at the end of the six-hour stand-off. Mr Kiraz, a father-of-two married to a judge who also worked at the courthouse, was targeted for his part in an investigation into the death of Berkin Elvan. The 15-year-old was severely wounded after being hit on the head by a tear-gas canister fired by a police officer during anti-government protests in Istanbul in June 2013. After spending 269 days in a coma, Elvan eventually died on March 11 last year. His death, and the subsequent investigation, have since become a rallying point for the country's far-left. Gathering: Prosecutors, lawyers and judges stand near a statue of Lady Justice during the funeral ceremony . A British national, of Polish origin but who has not been named, was arrested on Saturday as part of an operation against the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front, according to reports. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said this morning: 'I can confirm that a British national has been arrested in Turkey and that we are offering consular assistance.' Before imposing the blocks on the websites, Turkish authorities had tried to prevent newspapers printing images taken during the siege last week. The newspapers were accused by the government of 'spreading terrorist propaganda' in sharing the images of the hostage-taking. Presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said: 'This has to do with the publishing of the prosecutor's . picture. What happened in the aftermath (of the prosecutor's . killing) is as grim as the incident itself. 'The demand from the prosecutor's office is that this image . not be used anywhere in electronic platforms. 'The wife and children of prosecutor Kiraz have been deeply . upset. The images are everywhere.' He added: 'A request has been made to both Twitter and YouTube for the . removal of the images and posts but they have not accepted it . and no response has been given. 'That's why . this decision has been taken through a court in Istanbul.' Critical: Prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz was taken to hospital with gunshot wounds but died of his injuries . Strength of feeling: Elvan has since become an icon for the Turkish far-left and his supporters accuse the authorities of covering up the circumstances and perpetrators of his death . Google said it was working to restore service to the YouTube . video-sharing site, which it owns. Twitter also said it was . working to restore access for its users. Facebook said it had complied with a Turkish court order requiring it to restrict access to some content or face a block on its service. A company spokesman said it would appeal the order. Turkey's telecoms regulator could not immediately be reached . and there was no statement on its website. This is not the first time that Turkish authorities have imposed blocks on social media sites and networks. In the run-up to local elections in March 2014 blocks were imposed after recordings circulated allegedly revealing corruption among senior officials. Figures provided by Twitter revealed that Turkey filed more requests to remove content from the social network than any other nation between July and December 2014.",

    "source": "Patients tried and failed to book almost 34 million GP appointments last year, shocking new figures have revealed. A study reported in the British Medical Journal found that 90 per cent of patients were able to get an appointment in 2013/14. The 10 per cent who could not amounts to around 33.8 million unsuccessful attempts each year - or 81 per surgery each week. The shambolic situation is responsible for as many as a quarter of A&E visits, the researchers say. Lack of access: Patients tried and failed to book almost 34 million GP appointments last year . The figures, from the GP Patient Survey, also show that patients who report worse access to conventional GP appointments are more likely to use out-of-hours   services. And surgeries where patients were able to see a GP within two week days had lower rates of A&E department visits. Other research has suggested that greater access to GP surgeries is linked with lower rates of emergency admissions for conditions such as heart failure and stroke. The figures come just a day after it was revealed one in five visits to A&E are unnecessary. A fifth of patients turning up in A&E have self-treatable conditions including sore throats, athlete’s foot and head lice, a study has claimed. Researchers have calculated that more than 4 million visits a year are unnecessary – costing the NHS £290 million. Doctors have even reported patients showing up because they were hungover, their false nails were hurting or they had paint in their hair. The analysis of data from 15 A&E units by consultancy firm IMS Health found that 19 per cent of patients had what is called a ‘self-treatable condition’. The data covered one in ten A&E units across England, so if the trends are mirrored across the country, then an estimated 4.1million of the 21.7million visits last year were for minor ailments. The problem is largely caused by the fact that patients find it difficult to see a GP, particularly out of hours. Many go to A&E in the knowledge that they will at least be seen by a doctor that day, even if they have to wait four hours. Today's piece, written by academics from Imperial College London and New York University, points out that more GPs are required if access is to be improved. But they add politicians' promises of an extra 5,000 to 8,000 GPs are likely to be challenging to achieve. Effect: The situation is responsible for as many as a quarter of A&E visits, the researchers say. The new figures come just a day after it was revealed a fifth of patients turning up to casualty have self-treatable conditions including sore throats, athlete’s foot and head lice . So despite election pledges by the Tories and Labour to improve access to GPs appointments, they argue these promises are unlikely to be achieved within a parliamentary term. The 'public should [therefore] question the promises of politicians', they said. The BMJ report said largest increase in GPs over a previous parliamentary term in the past 20 years was 5,414 GPs (from 2004/05 to 2008/09) under Labour. But Labour's previous pledge for all appointments within 48 hours was 'far from being achieved', it adds. Only 81 per cent of patients ended up able to see a GP within two weekdays in 2009/10 when the party was last in government. The researchers add there is also no firm proof that more patients getting to see their doctor will lead to fewer A&E attendances. David Cameron has promised patients will be able to access GP surgeries between 8am and 8pm seven days a week by 2020 if the Tories are re-elected. Ed Miliband has guaranteed appointments within 48 hours if Labour are voted in. But the piece said these pledges may prove unrealistic, adding that the evidence behind them has not been made clear - and the problem with access has not been precisely defined. Denial: The study authors say that despite election pledges by the Tories and Labour (David Cameron and Ed Miliband are pictured, left to right) to improve access to GPs appointments, these promises are unlikely to be achieved within a parliamentary term . 'The aims and rationale of the policies outlined by the Conservative and Labour parties do not seem explicit,' the analysis said. 'One aim is undoubtedly to win election votes. But the aims for the NHS and for patients are less clear.' The analysis suggests five points of action 'for policy and research if improvements in access are pursued'. These are: . * Evaluating the extended opening hours pilot scheme carried out by the Tories . * Making general practice consultation data routinely available . * Looking at employing practice staff besides GPs . * Evaluating new types of appointment such as telephone consultations . * Considering alternatives to general practice such as pharmacist-led minor illness services. Lead author Thomas Cowling, of Imperial College London, said: 'Both parties have made bold promises about access to GP services, but the evidence behind their pledges is lacking. 'It's important that policies like extended access are independently evaluated before being implemented more widely. 'The pledges on increases to the GP workforce are very ambitious and unlikely to be met within a parliamentary term.' Instead, he recommended the NHS evaluates the use of new types of appointment that have been proposed to increase GP capacity, such as consultations and triage by phone or online. 'It should also consider other types of staff who could take on some of the work of GPs.'",

A study reported in the British Medical Journal found that 90 per cent of patients were able to get an appointment in 2013/14. The 10 per cent who could not amounts to around 33.8 million unsuccessful attempts each year - or 81 per surgery each week. The figures, from the GP Patient Survey, also show that patients who report worse access to conventional GP appointments are more likely to use out-of-hours services. And surgeries where patients were able to see a GP within two week days had lower rates of A&E department visits. Other research has suggested that greater access to GP surgeries is linked with lower rates of emergency admissions for conditions such as heart failure and stroke.",

Researchers have calculated that more than 4 million visits a year are unnecessary – costing the NHS £290 million. Doctors have even reported patients showing up because they were hungover, their false nails were hurting or they had paint in their hair. The analysis of data from 15 A&E units by consultancy firm IMS Health found that 19 per cent of patients had what is called a 'self-treatable condition'.

The researchers add there is also no firm proof that more patients getting to see their doctor will lead to fewer A&E attendances. David Cameron has promised patients will be able to access GP surgeries between 8am and 8pm seven days a week by 2020 if the Tories are re-elected. Ed Miliband has guaranteed appointments within 48 hours if Labour are voted in. The analysis suggests five points of action 'for policy and research if improvements in access are pursued', including evaluating extended opening hours, making consultation data available, looking at employing practice staff besides GPs, evaluating new types of appointments, and considering alternatives to general practice.",

    "source": "Former Leeds and England coach Tony Smith admits he was shocked by Kevin Sinfield's decision to switch codes but, on reflection, believes it could be an inspired decision. Sinfield, 34, the greatest captain in Leeds' history, stunned the world of rugby league with his sudden announcement that he will quit the sport at the end of the season and join the Rhinos' sister club Yorkshire Carnegie on an 18-month contract. Sinfield, who is closing in on third place in rugby league's all-time scoring list with 3,997 points, told a news conference at Headingley he did not want to play against Rhinos and that the opportunity to spearhead Carnegie's bid for a Premiership return was too good to resist. Leeds Rhinos captain Kevin Sinfield is to switch codes and join Yorkshire Carnegie at the end of the season . Sinfield (centre) lifts the Super League trophy after Leeds beat Warrington in the grand final in October 2012 . Warrington coach Tony Smith (left) speaks with fellow coaches Tony Rea and Brian McDermott . Smith, who was in charge of the Rhinos when Sinfield lifted the first of their six Super League titles in 2003, says he is sad to see his former skipper swap codes. 'I was a bit shocked,' Smith said. 'It took me a couple of minutes to think about it. He's a champion player, he's been a champion player for his club and his country for many years. 'I'm sad to lose him to that other code. However, I could understand the rationale. If it's a way of him plying his trade for longer - his trade of playing rugby and being a terrific professional - I can see why he's made that change. 'I think he'll have a lot to still contribute to their sport and to that club. It's not a huge switch for him in terms of training venues. 'He'll still have his bumps and bruises, but the fact that he can continue to do that and probably get well rewarded for it, I can't blame him.' Sinfield, whose bombshell announcement came just four days after his predecessor as England captain Jamie Peacock revealed he would be leaving Leeds at the end of the season to become football manager at Hull KR, has missed Leeds' last two games through injury and, according to Smith, is probably stepping down at the right time. Sinfield (left) in action for England against France during the 2013 Rugby League World Cup quarter-final . Sinfield is tackled during a match between Leeds Rhinos and Leigh Centurions last year . 'I think it's fantastic to make that decision to bow out of Super League probably at the right time,' Smith added. 'You can't keep playing forever and, when those young guys come snapping at your heels, it's hard to keep them at bay at some stage. 'You have to bite the bullet and step aside and I'd say the time is probably right. I'm no expert on when other people should retire but I'm pleased for Kevin and he'll certainly give everything he's got to his new employers. 'That's how he's been in rugby league and I've got no reason to think it'll be any different.' Sinfield has never played rugby union but already identified a role for himself in his new sport as he follows in the footsteps of Jason Robinson, Andy Farrell and Sam Burgess. 'Ideally I'd like to play fly-half,' Sinfield said. 'It's the position that suits the skill set I have the best. Sinfield and his Leeds team-mates celebrate after beating Melbourne Storm in the 2008 World Club Challenge . 'I understand the challenge that's in front of me and the difficulties rugby league players have faced crossing over. That's why I think I'm in the best possible place to help with that transition. 'Playing union is something I've always wanted to do. I didn't want to end my career and have regrets about missed opportunities. When this opportunity came up I knew it was the right thing. 'I'm excited by it. I know the potential at the club and it's something I'd like to be a part of. 'I'm very respectful of the game and I like watching it. I think a lot of rugby league people look down on rugby union, and I think a lot of rugby union people look down on rugby league. But I like both games. As a sportsman, to get the opportunity to play another professional sport is something that really appeals to me.'",

    "source": "Jason Orange shocked Take That fans around the world when he quit the chart-topping band last September but he hasn't said goodbye to them forever. Busy man: Gary Barlow is preparing for his musical Finding Neverland to open and the new Take That tour to begin . For as the remaining members Gary Barlow, Mark Owen and Howard Donald prepare to hit the road as a trio on their new tour - opening in Glasgow on April 27 - Gary has revealed to MailOnline that Jason will be proudly cheering on his former bandmates. Speaking exclusively to MailOnline ahead of the premiere of his new Broadway musical Finding Neverland on Wednesday, Gary said: 'He wants to come to the shows, he'll definitely be there. I don't think we'll be able to get him up on stage but he'll be there.' Regarding Jason's departure, Gary added: 'I think we've gotten used to it. It was very strange to start with it but it's been over six months. 'We're just so excited to hit the road. People come to a Take That show expecting an extravaganza and that's exactly what they're going to get.' However, before Gary can get back to the UK for tour rehearsals, he has the small matter of seeing his musical open on Broadway. And as he waited for the premiere to take place in New York on Wednesday, Gary admitted he was feeling equal parts nervous and excited. He said: 'It's felt like a little secret for so long and it felt like it was never ever going to happen. It feels quite weird to hand over our little baby and have everyone see it.' It was the new Late Late Show host James Corden who first put Gary in touch with Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein when he was looking for someone to write the score for his musical Finding Neverland. He'll be back: Gary told MailOnline that Jason (second left) is excited to come and see his former bandmates on their new tour . Speaking of James, Gary said: I feel like I'm going to owe him for the rest of my life and he's loving that at the moment. He's doing brilliant on The Late Late Show and if he'd have us we'd definitely go on and perform some songs from the musical.' Speaking about Hollywood supremo Harvey, Gary admitted he was surprised by how much creative control Weinstein gave him and co-writer Eliot Kennedy. 'He's someone that I'd heard about and I was really keen to meet him,' Gary told MailOnline. When he called me up I was definitely interested. 'I didn't know how he worked but now I realise he is a creative. He completely trusted our music. We've had an amazing couple of years.' And then there were three: Gary promised fans that they can expect an 'extravaganza' when they come to see the new tour . It's not goodbye: Jason Orange shocked Take That fans around the world when he quit the chart-topping band last September but he hasn't said goodbye to them forever . While Gary had a taste of Hollywood when he performed songs from Finding Neverland at Harvey's pre-Oscars party, he insisted he will be sticking to writing and not asking Harvey to cast him in a new project. 'The last time I acted was on Heartbeat in 1998,' Gary said. 'Diane, the director of Neverland, always calls me JM Gary and says she is going to get me up on stage. 'I cannot act whatsoever, so I think I'm just going to stick to writing and singing.' 'He completely trusted our music': Gary revealed Hollywood mogul and Finding Neverland producer Harvey Weinstein has been extremely encouraging since bringing him on to write the music for the Broadway musical . Big night: On Wednesday Gary's Finding Neverland had its Broadway premiere . That's what friends are for: It was the new Late Late Show host James Corden who first put Gary in touch with Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein when he was looking for someone to write the score for his musical . Meanwhile, Gary admitted he is dismayed by Louis Walsh's recent declaration that his X Factor days could be numbered and said he hopes the veteran judge doesn't leave. Barlow exclusively told MailOnline: 'I really hope he doesn't leave. To me he's the life of that show. He brings the silliness to it and that's what everyone loves. He's a big part of it behind the scenes too. I don't think they should lose him. I think what could happen is he might leave and then they'll get to auditions and send a plane for him.' Stronger than ever: Gary believes that Zayn Malik's (second left) departure from One Direction won't stop the band going on to even greater success . Just as Jason Orange's departure from Take That shocked fans, so too did Zayn Malik's recent decision to quit One Direction. But Gary believes the remaining members Niall Horan, Harry Styles, Liam Payne and Louis Tomlinson will come out it stronger than ever. Gary, who also saw Robbie Williams leave Take That in 1995, said: 'I think it's slightly easier for the band. You can lean on each other. I think it's always harder for the one who leaves. 'For One Direction it's just a transitional period. Like us their fans are very supportive.' Finding Neverland, directed by Diane Paulus, explores the Peter Pan book's back story and stars Matthew Morrison of Glee and former Frasier star Kelsey Grammer. Performances begin March 15 at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre. Former co-star: Gary admitted he is dismayed by Louis Walsh's recent declaration that his X Factor days could be numbered and said he hopes the veteran judge doesn't leave .",

I don't think we'll be able to get him up on stage but he'll be there.' Regarding Jason's departure, Gary added: 'I think we've gotten used to it. It was very strange to start with it but it's been over six months. 'We're just so excited to hit the road. People come to a Take That show expecting an extravaganza and that's exactly what they're going to get.'",

It was the new Late Late Show host James Corden who first put Gary in touch with Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein when he was looking for someone to write the score for his musical Finding Neverland. Speaking of James, Gary said: I feel like I'm going to owe him for the rest of my life and he's loving that at the moment. Finding Neverland, directed by Diane Paulus, explores the Peter Pan book's back story and stars Matthew Morrison of Glee and former Frasier star Kelsey Grammer.

    "source": "A Mississippi Senator's personal assistant has been charged with trafficking drugs from China to use as payment for sexual favors. Police launched an investigation after seizing a package on April 9 with over a kilo of the date rape drug GBL addressed to  Fred Pagan, office manager and personal assistant to Sen. Thad Cochran (R-MS). Raiding his home on Thursday, they uncovered 181.5 grams of meth. Senator: Thad Cochran (R-MS) has yet to comment on the fact that his personal assistant and office manager Fred Pagan has been charged with trafficking drugs, including methamphetamine, from China . Pagan was paid $160,000 in his Senate role last year, the Washington Post reports. The paper states Pagan, 49, has worked for Cochran since he was 16 years old. He is charged with one count of possession and intent to distribute methamphetamine and one count of importing a controlled substance. The former is punishable by five to 40 years in prison, the latter by up to 20. Pagan was released on Friday after an initial court appearance. He will appear again on May 14. Court documents read by The Washington City Paper say Pagan admits he acquired three loads of drugs through a dealer. He is accused of buying the substances to exchange for sexual favors. Sen Cochran's spokesman Chris Gallegos confirmed a staff member had been arrested but refused to confirm further details. He told the City Paper: 'Our office is in the process of consulting with Senate legal counsel.' GBL, the drug Cochran allegedly acquired from a dealer in China, is similar to the date rape drug GHB. It is illegal to manufacture or sell either variant of the drug in the United States. Users can face two years in prison, suppliers up to 14 years. The drug, which is in liquid form, is packaged is select types of plastic as it is said to burn through many normal types of packaging.",

On the show hapless character Rachel decided to treat her loved ones to what she mistakenly thought was 'a traditional English trifle' layered with all the trimmings - including ladyfingers, jam, custard, beef sautéed with peas and onions, a little more custard, bananas and some whipped cream. Now one brave Mancunian has whipped up their own version of the unusual concoction - replacing the beef with the far more traditional lamb. Scroll down for video . Neil Killham made the infamous shepherds pie-trifle combination immortalised on Friends 16 years ago. It features sponge, jam, custard, lamb, peas, onions, whipped cream and is garnished with sprinkles . Neil Killham, a 32-year-old software engineer from Manchester, announced his plans on Twitter with a picture of his clashing ingredients with the caption: 'It's finally time. I'm making The Trifle Out Of Friends.' Giving a running commentary on the social media site, Neil proudly showed off the finished masterpiece which actually looked very respectable - until he cut into it. He told his followers that while it does not taste like feet - as characters on the show claimed - it was still 'f****** horrible'. He added: 'But with enough nice trifle stuff that we keeping eating more of it.' The trifle-shepherds pie combination did not look quite as appetising once it had been sliced into . Friends character Rachel Green (played by Jennifer Aniston) accidentally made the disgusting dessert . Neil posted this picture of a friend attempting a second go at the trifle pie - it doesn't appear to have improved . 'I thought I'd be able to compartmentalise the clashing flavours, but I cannot.' When MailOnline asked how it tasted, Neil, who shared the dish with friends, said: 'It tasted terrible of course - but not so bad that I couldn't finish my slice. 'It's the way you sometimes think you've got lucky and got a nice pure trifle bite and then pow! Lamb!' He said in the last year he has made curry flavoured cupcakes, a chilli cheesecake and a pancake pizza, among other things. 'Usually they kind of work, so I figured it was time to try something that definitely wouldn't,' he said. 'Although when I tried sprouts in marmite that didn't work either, but it wasn't as bad as this. 'A couple of people tried it with me last night and agreed it was terrible. Opinions were mixed on whether the lamb or the onion was the biggest problem. 'Then a couple of people at work also tried it and came to similar conclusions. 'Except for one guy who said \"it wasn't that bad really. Not good, but not the worst\". 'I'm not sure I can trust him any more.' The trifle looked distinctly unappetising when dished up on a plate - and apparently tasted even worse . In the show the dessert was described as half trifle, half shepherd's pie after two pages in the English cookery book Rachel was using stuck together - but the creators mistakenly used beef instead of the lamb which is traditional in the pie. Towards the end of the season six episode the penny finally drops and Rachel says: 'I wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle!' If for some reason you would like to recreate this Heston Blumenthal-esque clash of flavours and textures, the recipe would appear to be: A layer of sponge, layer of jam, layer of custard, layer of raspberries, another layer of sponge, layer of lamb sautéed with peas and onions, a bit more custard, banana, and a topping of whipped cream garnished with hundreds and thousands .",

He managed to finish his slice despite the poor taste, though the experience left others questioning their trust in his judgment. The infamous 'Friends' Thanksgiving episode featured Rachel accidentally combining two cookbook pages, creating a bizarre dessert that was half English trifle and half shepherd's pie. The recipe included traditional trifle layers (ladyfingers, jam, custard) mixed with savory shepherd's pie ingredients (ground beef, peas, onions).",

Zenit St Petersburg striker Hulk dressed up as the aforementioned superhero at the latest Avengers movie . The 28-year-old (right) recently signed a new long-term deal at Zenit until the end of the 2018-19 season . Hulk, who has 41 caps for Brazil, recently signed a new long-term deal at the Russian club until the end of the 2018-19 season. Zenit's No 7's previous deal, reportedly worth more than £5million a year, had been due to expire in summer 2017. The club did not provide any financial details of the new contract - with the striker having netted 15 goals in 33 appearances for the Russian giants in all competitions at present. Hulk's new contract comes at a time when many Russian football clubs are struggling with financial problems because of the low value of the ruble, which has lost almost half of its value against the dollar in the last 12 months - with Rotor Volgograd going bankrupt earlier this month. Top players in Russia are typically paid in dollars or euros, but club budgets are in rubles, putting pressure on clubs' finances. Hulk (centre) has netted 15 goals in 33 appearances for the Russian giants in all competitions at present .",

    "source": "Many couples disagree over what to name their children — but one New York couple’s battle over their unborn baby’s moniker became so unbearable that they have asked random members of the public to help them reach a decision. Kseniya Soukeras, who is due in August, wants to name her unborn child Michael, after her late father. Her husband Nicholas prefers the Greek name Spyridon, after his own father. Because they have been unable to settle their disagreement privately, the couple has turned to the general public to help them make a decision; Nicholas, 37, has launched an online petition asking for help to sway his wife. Baby name showdown: Nicholas and Kseniya Soukeras can't agree over whether to name their child Spyridon or Michael, which Nicholas says his wife will shorten to Mischa . 'The argument is serious — it’s not a joke,' Kseniya, 33, told the New York Post. 'I don’t want to call my son something I can’t even pronounce.' According to the petition, Kseniya finds the name Spyridon 'archaic, base, bereft of elegance and unsuitable for a child living in 21st century America'. But Nicholas argues that his wife simply has not had the opportunity to grow to like the name, and that her 'Russian ear is not trained for the sweet, musical sounds of our Greek nomenclature'. Rich history: Nicholas says the name Spyridon 'has been held by the highest and most honored officials and patriots of both the U.S. and the former Soviet Union' However, the nights of 'bickering about it back and forth' may be moot: the couple does not even know for sure whether they are even having a son. 'My husband is convinced. He thinks he’s a psychic... he thinks he can see through the belly,' says Kseniya. In fact, if the couple has a girl, Nicholas is willing to let Kseniya choose the name; he also says that if they name their first born son Spyridon, his wife can choose the name of their second son. Mystery child: The couple doesn't yet know the sex of their baby; if it's a girl, Nicolas will surrender all naming rights to Kseniya . While they wait to find out, Nicholas is hoping to get 100,000 signatures supporting his choice — the magic number that his wife agreed would be enough for him to get his way. 'I’ll settle for 100,000 — this is an approximate population of my hometown Maladzyechna,' says Kseniya, who was born in Belarus. Nicholas is still far off from his goal, but his nuanced plea has so far garnered over 200 supporters.",

    "generated": "A New York couple has taken their baby-naming dispute public after failing to reach a private agreement. The wife, Kseniya Soukeras, wants to name their unborn child Michael after her deceased father, while husband Nicholas advocates for the Greek name Spyridon, after his father. In an unusual move, Nicholas has created an online petition seeking public input to help resolve their disagreement. A married couple is in dispute over naming their son Spyridon, with the Russian-born mother opposing and the Greek father defending the traditional name choice. A couple's naming dispute has an interesting twist: they don't yet know the baby's gender. The husband seeks 100,000 petition signatures to name a potential son Spyridon, while offering compromises if they have a girl or future children.",

In an unusual move, Nicholas has created an online petition seeking public input to help resolve their disagreement. A married couple is in dispute over naming their son Spyridon, with the Russian-born mother opposing and the Greek father defending the traditional name choice. A couple's naming dispute has an interesting twist: they don't yet know the baby's gender. The husband seeks 100,000 petition signatures to name a potential son Spyridon, while offering compromises if they have a girl or future children.",

    "source": "It was once the edgiest place in town, attracting the word's biggest bands to its iconic stage - but 30 years later Cleveland's Variety Theater is silent. The venue was renowned for its rock concerts but everything changed in 1984 when heavy metal band Motorhead played a gig so loud it literally began to bring the house down. As the crowd went wild over the group's unique ear-shattering brand of music, the ceiling cracked and pieces of plaster began to fall on the audience - ending the concert and the life of the Variety Theater in one deafening shriek. Abandoned for 30 years: The Variety Theater in Cleveland was once a buzzing music venue but was closed down after the ceiling cracked during a Motorhead gig in 1984 . The power was cut off to stop the band from playing and two years later a judge ordered the theater to be sealed off for good. Built in 1927, The Variety Theater was home to one of the earliest single screen cinemas in Cleveland, Ohio, before becoming an iconic music venue. The 20,000 sq ft main stage hosted the likes of  Metallica, the Dead Kennedy's and R.E.M. before Motorhead's fatal performance on December 2 1984. Since then it has stayed abandoned and hidden from public eye until now, thirty years later, a photographer has captured a collection of eery images offering a fascinating glimpse into music history. Seph Lawless, the 37-year-old photojournalist from Cleveland who took these incredible pictures, said: 'I'm Cleveland born and raised and I've always been into rock and roll. 'This theater has gone down in folklore in my hometown and it always had that air of mystery when we were kids growing up. Crumbling and rotting remains: The once-iconic Ohio venue was sealed off on the order of a judge in 1986, two years after Motorhead's gig . 'It was really inspiring to go in and photograph the theater, it's something I've always wanted to do and at times it actually felt like I was stepping back in time. 'I love rock and roll music so it was just incredible, it was like a time capsule to that era and that all the bands who performed there were captured in the fabric of the building.' Seph is a photojournalist specialising in nostalgic pictures. He recently completed a trip around the United States where he took photographs of abandoned or neglected buildings in every state. Due to the efforts of The Friends of the Historic Variety Theater, an organization that owns the huge building, a scheme to regenerate the venue have been given a new lease of life. The group is said to have plans to spruce up the theater section of the building, turning it into a music venue once more. Slow decay of time: Many of the theater's wooden seats have fallen into disrepair while the staircase shows the effects of years of decay . Renowned venue: Before its closure, the theater hosted concerts from bands including Metallica, the Dead Kennedy's and R.E.M. Hidden from view: The stunning pictures were taken by 37-year-old photojournalist Seph Lawless, who has lived in Cleveland all his life . Silent halls: The walls are cracked and chipped and the tiles on the floor have rotted after three decades of abandonment . Ruled to be unsafe: The venue was closed after the ceiling cracked and pieces of plaster began to fall on the audience during a 1984 gig . Open for half a century: Built in 1927, The Variety Theater was home to one of the earliest single screen cinemas in Cleveland, Ohio, before becoming an iconic music venue . Regeneration: The Friends of the Historic Variety Theater have plans to spruce up the theater section of the building and rent out the structure’s eight retail store-fronts . Dated equipment: Most of the building's machinery has been languishing for years since the venue's unfortunate closure . 1920s-style décor: The theater had kept its vintage style for decades and left everything untouched when it was sealed up in 1986 . Enticing: Mr Lawless said the theater 'has gone down in folklore' in Cleveland and always 'had that air of mystery' to it when he was a child . Fatal concert: During Motorhead's 1984 gig, the power was cut off to stop the band from playing and two years later the venue was cosed . A glimpse of the past: A peek through a broken piece of wall reveals the lit up stage of the Variety Theater in dramatic fashion . Fascinating history: There are now plans to restore the decaying building to a live music venue . Coated in dust: Mr Lawless is a photojournalist specialising in nostalgic pictures. He recently completed a trip around the United States where he took photographs of abandoned or neglected buildings in every state .",

    "generated": "Cleveland's legendary Variety Theater met its dramatic end during a 1984 Motorhead concert when the band's extreme volume caused the ceiling to crack and collapse, forcing an immediate evacuation and permanent closure. The Variety Theater in Cleveland evolved from a 1927 single-screen cinema into a legendary music venue, hosting major acts before its infamous closure following a Motorhead concert in 1984. The 20,000 sq ft venue holds significant cultural importance in Cleveland's entertainment history. The Historic Variety Theater, after decades of abandonment, is now poised for revival through the efforts of its current owners, The Friends of the Historic Variety Theater. Recent photographic documentation has captured the venue's current state, while plans are underway to restore it as a music venue.",

The Variety Theater in Cleveland evolved from a 1927 single-screen cinema into a legendary music venue, hosting major acts before its infamous closure following a Motorhead concert in 1984. The 20,000 sq ft venue holds significant cultural importance in Cleveland's entertainment history. The Historic Variety Theater, after decades of abandonment, is now poised for revival through the efforts of its current owners, The Friends of the Historic Variety Theater. Recent photographic documentation has captured the venue's current state, while plans are underway to restore it as a music venue.",

    "source": "A mother whose teenage daughter was tortured to death by her sadistic lover has spoken for the first time of her heartbreak. Margaret Bates, from Mottram, Tameside, said she is still unable to read the autopsy report detailing the 150 injuries her 17-year-old daughter Kelly-Anne suffered at the hands of her violent lover James Smith. Too traumatised to speak about her only daughter's death until now, Mrs Bates, 60, said she is consumed by one thought - that she wished she had killed Smith when she first met him. Margaret and Tommy Bates are speaking about their daughter Kelly-Anne's brutal murder for the first time . Kelly-Anne Bates enjoys time with her friends . Mrs Bates, who has two sons, Andrew, 39, and Paul, 33, said: 'I know I shouldn’t say this, but I wish I’d killed him the first time I saw him. That way Kelly would still be alive.' Over three barbaric weeks, Smith burnt Kelly-Anne with an iron, scalded her with boiling water and even gouged out her eyes. Smith also tied her to a radiator by her hair, broke her arm and knees and stabbed her all over her body with knives, forks and scissors, causing 150 separate injuries before beating her with a shower head and drowning her in the bath. Throughout the horrific onslaught, the terrified teenager was alive, begging for mercy. Smith, who was then 49, got life imprisonment and must serve a minimum of 25 years for his horrific crimes. Next year marks the 20th anniversary of Kelly-Anne's death, but Mrs Bates said even with the passage of time, she and her husband Tommy, 66, are unable to read the post-mortem report which details the injuries their daughter endured. Flashback: Kelly-Anne and her mother Margaret on holiday in Barry Island, Wales . 'Every now and again, I phone the coroner to ask for the post-mortem report but each time I back out. I can't face it - I never will,' she said. Mrs Bates said as a little girl, Kelly-Anne was a tomboy who loved playing football with her friends. She also adored children, and often babysat for neighbours. She said: 'Kelly loved children and wanted to be a teacher. She was soft-hearted and very maternal.' Sadistic killer James Smith . At 14, while babysitting for a friend, Kelly-Anne met James Smith. He began a grooming process which was so secretive that her parents knew nothing about him for two years. When Kelly-Anne was 15, she stayed out over night and her panicked parents called the police. When she finally came home, the following morning, she claimed to have stayed over with a schoolfriend called Rachel. Mrs Bates said: 'I knew she was lying. It wasn't like her, but I'd no idea what was going on. 'Kelly was a good girl. As well as babysitting, she had a job on a market stall at weekends. She played hockey and she was clever at school. She was hard-working and sensible and I could never have dreamed she was being groomed by a monster.' She said Kelly-Anne once arrived home with a black eye and told her parents she had been attacked by a gang of girls in the street. Soon afterwards, Kelly-Anne announced she had a new boyfriend, James Smith, who she said was 32 years old. 'The first time I met him, he swaggered down the stairs and it made the hairs stand up on the back of my neck,' said Mrs Bates. 'He was much older than I expected and this wasn’t the man I wanted for my daughter. I vividly recall seeing our bread knife in the kitchen and wanting to pick it up and stab him in the back. 'It was a bizarre thought - I would never normally think of anything so violent and now I wonder whether it was some sort of sixth sense. 'I’ve thought about that many times.' Kelly-Anne and her brothers Andrew and Paul have some fun on the beach . Margaret Bates said Kelly-Anne was very maternal and here the teenager feeds a baby . Margaret Bates and her only daughter Kelly-Anne as a baby . Mrs Bates called police and social services but because Kelly-Anne was 16 they could not help. She said: 'I didn’t know what do to. She was very strong-minded and she wouldn’t listen to me. And I was worried that, if I fell out with her, it would just push them closer together. 'One night she came home and her face was black and blue. Another time, her hand was bruised. I suspected Smith was hitting her, but Kelly-Anne denied it. 'I rang the police but they said there was nothing they could do without a statement from Kelly.' In November 1995, 17-year-old Kelly-Anne moved in with Smith who lived in Gorton, Manchester. Kelly-Anne gets to grips with crutches after injuring herself as a teenager . She spoke to her parents most weeks on the phone, when Smith was present, but never saw them again. Mrs Bates said: 'In addition to worrying about Kelly-Anne, our youngest son, Paul, was in hospital for weeks and I had a hernia operation too, so our lives were thrown into chaos. 'We even went round to Smith's address to try to persuade her to come home, but he was there all the time. The young Kelly-Anne smiles for the camera . 'On one visit he showed me a hole in his floor boards where he said he'd had a gas leak. 'Just a few weeks later, he kept Kelly prisoner in the hole while he tortured her.' Mrs Bates said she then discovered that Smith was 48 years old - 21 years older than Kelly-Anne. She said she pleaded with Kelly-Anne to leave him, but by now, Smith controlled all their contact. In the weeks before her death, Kelly-Anne endured unimaginable torture while her family - terrified of pushing her even further into Smith’s clutches - waited by the phone. 'In April, I got a Mother's Day card from Kelly in Smith's handwriting and I'd had enough,' she said. 'But I was torn; I didn't want to keep going round there because I thought it was making things worse. 'It haunts me to think if we had gone round there she would be alive today.' Mrs Bates said she contacted the police domestic violence unit and was encouraged to give her daughter its leaflets. Tragically, Mrs Bates was never to see Kelly-Anne again and said she still has the leaflets to this day. On April 16, 1996, Mrs Bates said police arrived to tell them that Kelly-Anne was dead. Kelly-Anne had been starved and had lost more than three stone in weight. Loving tribute: A floral tribute bearing Kelly-Anne's name at her funeral, which took place the day before her 18th birthday . Her body was so badly mutilated that police and pathologists said it was the worst case of abuse they had ever seen. The jury at Smith's trial was offered counselling due to the horrific details of the case. Kelly-Anne was buried the day before her 18th birthday. Smith was jailed for life in November 1997 and during the trial it emerged that he had a horrific history of violence towards women. Mr and Mrs Bates have now set up a local branch of the national support group Support After Murder or Manslaughter (SAMM) for other parents and have found some comfort in helping other families. 'I wish I had killed Smith myself,' added Mrs Bates. 'I want him to die just like Kelly did. Not a day goes by when I don’t think that. 'But he had her in his clutches and I couldn’t save her.' Flowers, cards and messages are piled up on Kelly-Anne's grave .",

Jack, the Las Vegas-based Swede who fights under the banner of Floyd Mayweather Jr.'s promotion company, connected with a big one-two combination in the ninth round and forced the fight inside on a tiring Dirrell (27-1-1). Badou Jack (left) connects with Anthony Dirrell during the WBC world super-middleweight title fight . Jack holds his belt after beating Dirrell on Friday night at the UIC Pavilion in Chicago, Illinois . George Groves will fight  Jack for the WBC world super-middleweight title as he is mandatory challenger . 'I was in great shape and I believed in myself,' Jack said. 'All that talk don't matter. I knew they couldn't rob me. I thought I clearly won. It was a tough start to my career, but now I'm a world champ.' The 31-year-old Jack has won three straight fights after being stopped in the first round by Derek Edwards in 2014. The 30-year-old Dirrell, from Flint, Michigan, won the title in August with a tough decision over veteran Sakio Bika. Dirrell was diagnosed with non-Hodgkins lymphoma and sidelined for 20 months. He also previously broke his leg and wrist in a motorcycle accident. On the undercard, Danny Jacobs, four years removed from a fight with cancer, stopped Caleb Truax in the 12th round to successfully defend his WBA middleweight title. With a comfortable lead heading into the final round, the 27-year-old Jacobs dropped Truax with a left-right combination and finished him off with a blistering array of punches against the ropes. Jack connects with previously unbeaten Dirrell during the world super-middleweight fight on Friday night .

    "source": "A passenger plane trying to land at a Texas airport turned back when the pilot discovered that the runway lights had been switched off. American Eagle Flight 2536 was scheduled to fly about 125 miles from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport to Wichita Falls, Texas, on Sunday night. The plane left nearly a half-hour late, and when it got to Wichita Falls, the pilot told passengers that the runway lights were turned off and there was nobody at the airport to turn them on, according to officials in the city of 100,000 people. Plane: American Eagle Flight 2536 was scheduled to fly about 125 miles from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport to Wichita Falls, Texas, on Sunday night (file photo) Wichita Falls officials first said that the Eagle pilot had the wrong radio frequency to turn on the lights on the main, 13,000-foot runway. Like many other small airports where control towers are not staffed around the clock, pilots in Wichita Falls can operate the runway lights with their radio system. But on Tuesday, city aviation director John Burrus said that Sheppard Air Force Base, which shares the facility, had closed the runway and turned off the lights. Burrus said Sheppard notified pilots of the closure. He added that the American Eagle jet could have landed on an adjacent, 10,000-foot runway that was lit. A spokesman for ExpressJet, a regional carrier that operated the flight under contract with American Airlines, said late Tuesday that the airline was still trying to determine what happened. 'The pilot attempted to activate the lights, but he couldn't do so,' said Jarek Beem, the ExpressJet spokesman. He said he didn't know why the pilot didn't land on the shorter runway. 'We're still reviewing the entire incident.' Beem said the pilot circled Wichita Falls for about 30 minutes before giving up and turning back to DFW. The plane, with 45 passengers, made an otherwise uneventful midnight landing at DFW after a one hour, 40-minute flight, according to tracking service FlightAware.com. Wichita Falls officials first said that the American Eagle pilot had the wrong radio frequency to turn on the lights on the main, 13,000-foot runway (file photo)",

    "source": "A woman who fractured her neighbour's skull with a hammer during a street fight as part of an eight-year feud has been jailed. Lisa Williams, 49, hit taxi driver David Coleman three times after finding the 54-year-old brawling with her brother in the street, a court heard. The two families had been 'neighbours at war' since the Colemans moved in next door to the Williams family on St Catherine’s Road, Chingford, in 2007. Lisa Williams (pictured leaving court, left) hit taxi driver David Coleman (right) three times with the hammer during a street fight . On the morning of the attack, the court heard that William's sibling Jonathan had smeared mud all over the Coleman's front bay windows. When the victim went to confront him, they got into a fight. James Benson, prosecuting, said: ‘Mr Coleman is not a small man but fairly well built, Jonathan Williams is bigger built still and is in fact a younger man than Mr Coleman,’ he said. ‘Between the two of them punches were thrown by both parties, this was before Lisa Williams had anything to do with the incident. ‘Ultimately the parties say Mr Williams gained the upper hand in the fight as the bigger and younger man, and both me went to the ground.’ At that point the bigger man allegedly straddled Mr Coleman as Williams emerged from their house holding a claw hammer, she then struck him three times to the head. She was only stopped when a third neighbour Bernard Mason, pulled the hammer out of her hands, and his wife Pamela was forced to sit on the her until the police arrived. Williams admitted striking Mr Coleman with a hammer, but claimed she believed he was about to kill her brother and she acted out of panic. Warring neighbours: The two families were described as ‘neighbours at war’ after the Colemans (left) moved in next door to the Williams' home (right) Before fetching the hammer she called 999 from  house she shared with her brother and mother, who can be heard screaming ‘leave him alone, leave him alone’ in the background. Williams was convicted of unlawfully wounding Mr Coleman after a trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court in February. Mr Benson described the two families as ‘neighbours at war’. The victim told the court that the Williams family had an irrational hatred of him. He claimed they would throw dog faeces over their garden fence and let their pet bark all hours of the day. Mr Coleman also believed they would be deliberately noisy and bang on the walls in the morning so he couldn't sleep after a night shift. However, Recorder Richard Sutton told the family ‘it takes two to Tango’. In a victim impact statement, Mr Coleman said he still suffers headaches and anxiety as a result of the attack, and often has to take days off work as a result. Isobel McCarroll, for Williams, said: ‘On the day in questions they were doing home improvements, her brother was out the front and she was doing some gardening, the hammer was in the hallway. ‘She came across an incident that was in full swing, she was nothing to do with the initial fighting - she came across something that must have been a terrifying scene and she rang 999 first.’ Williams, 49, was jailed for 30 months today at Snaresbrook Crown Court in London (pictured) after she was found guilty of maliciously wounding Mr Coleman . ‘She then went and tried to split the parties up, she went back in and she didn’t know if she was going to call 999 again and when she was in she saw the hammer - it might go a considerable way to mitigating the actions that followed. ‘It was three blows in quick succession and thankfully it was stopped by Mr Mason.’ She said Williams, who has no previous convictions, has been living apart from her family for two years since the incident and the family are now selling their home on St Catherine’s Road. Jailing Williams for two years and six months, the judge said: ‘You find yourself in a very, very sad situation as you no doubt appreciate, and it has come about because of the situation that has evolved between you and your neighbours. ‘This in my view was an incident waiting to happen and it was going to be serious and both sides were quite prepared for confrontation as and when it arose. ‘That’s the problem if it becomes violent, you never quite know where it is going to end - I understand that you thought the only way to respond to what was taking place was to arm yourself and it’s that action that the law finds unallowable and therefore criminal. ‘I accept that there was a substantial amount of provocation’. Williams was also barred from contacting the Coleman family indefinitely and ordered to pay a £120 surcharge.",

    "source": "Racing legend Tony McCoy ended his career as a jump jockey without adding to his haul of more than 4,300 winners. His two, third-place finishes at Sandown Park in front of a packed crowd of 18,000 race fans brought an end to the greatest racing career in history. McCoy, 40, has been champion jump jockey for the past 20 years, and when he was handed the trophy for the final time today by former Arsenal player Ian Wright, it emerged that the Irish jockey will be allowed to keep it in perpetuity. An emotional Tony McCoy takes a moment after he finished third in his 17,630th race at Sandown Park . Some 18,000 people packed Sandown Park to see the 20-time Champion Jockey on his final two rides . McCoy was joined on stage by his wife Chanelle and daughter Eve and young son Archie . McCoy, known to racing fans as AP, was cheered on by his wife Chanelle, and children Archie and Eve. In a career that has lasted more than 25 years, McCoy has ridden in more than 17,000 races and fallen an estimated 1,000 times breaking almost every bone in his body at least once. McCoy looked clearly emotional has he waved to the crowd after finishing third aboard Box Office in his final race. The record-breaking jockey admitted that, unusually, he had difficulty sleeping last night before his final professional rides. McCoy has been Champion Jockey in Britain and Ireland since 1996. During his career he has had 4,348 winners since his first victory in in Thurles, in Tipperary, Ireland on March 26, 1992 aboard Legal Steps. His first British winner was in Exeter in 1994, riding Chickabiddy to victory. AP McCoy was reduced to tears as he competed as a professional jockey for the last-ever time on Saturday . An emotional McCoy couldn't contain his emotions as he waved to the crowd after his last race . McCoy was congratulated by fellow jockeys as he prepared for his final ever race after in Sandown Park . Speaking to Channel 4, McCoy said: 'Today has been way beyond my expectations and thanks to Sandown and all the people who have been here today. It’s been an honour and a privilege. I’ve had a brilliant way of life for the past 25 years. 'I think it’s so much easier to enjoy and be successful in what you do if you like the people you work with and I’ve been incredibly lucky in that respect.' After the race, he was joined on stage by his family where he addressed the crowd. 'I would like to thank the BHA for allowing me to keep the trophy. I have had it a long time. 'I don't think I will ever celebrate retirement. I feel more sadness but I aware it had to happen It felt very different driving in and going into the Weighing Room. 'I went into the sauna for three-quarters of an hour and I will probably never go into one in my life again. 'There has been the last time this and the last time that over the last few weeks but this really is the last time. Last night was probably the first time in my life I didn't sleep well. My routine is going to have to change so much I will have to adapt.' McCoy announced his retirement in February but it was only the passing of the Grand National and his last rides at Cheltenham that made reality hit home. The racing legend was swamped by photographers and punters following his last professional race . McCoy was presented the Champion Jockey trophy by Ian Wright - McCoy is an Arsenal fanatic . McCoy added: 'Race riding has been an addiction. The reason in the last two weeks I have not been riding as much was because I wanted to get myself prepared. 'That is why I announced my retirement when I did. I wanted to prepare myself for not being a jockey. 'I thought that was the best way of coping with it. It has been easy until the last couple of weeks. I am well aware the next two days , two weeks, two months, two years are going to be the most difficult.' 'I have been very lucky and what I would say to the young lads in the weighing room enjoy every moment of it. 'In any sport to be successful you have to be prepared to work harder than anyone else. I think I have got talent but I have never thought I am the best at anything. When I look back I don't think I leave much behind.' In his final race, he was beaten by his long-time rival and friend Richard Johnson - who has been runner-up in the Champion Jockey race to McCoy for the past fifteen years. Speaking after the race, McCoy tipped his friend to take over from him next season. 'I’d like Richard Johnson to be Champion Jockey because he made me achieve a lot of the things that I did. 'I would never have achieved the numbers I have done if it wasn’t for Richard Johnson. That’s no disrespect to Sam Twiston-Davies or Tom Scudamore or Jason Maguire. We have numerous lads who could be Champion Jockey, but personally I would like Richard Johnson to be Champion Jockey.' In advance of his final rides today, stars from across sport, entertainment and racing paid tribute to McCoy, among them, Arsene Wenger, manager of his beloved Arsenal. The Arsenal boss said: 'I would like to congratulate you AP on your outstanding career. It’s absolutely exceptional what you have done and at Arsenal, who we know you support, we are inspired by that kind of dedication, quality and consistency that you have achieved in your career. Well done.' Presenter Clare Balding said: 'I admire him so much for his skill in the saddle, for his dedication to the sport, for being able to stay at the top of his game for 20 years. 'But I almost admire him more for turning away now, for being able to bow out at the top, I think that takes so much courage. He knows he could carry on for another five years but he doesn’t want to doubt himself. 'He knows that if he doubts himself for a second that will travel down the reigns and the horses won’t believe what he’s always believed, that he is the best.' Sandown Park was packed with fans eager to watch McCoy in his penultimate race on Saturday . The retiring 20-time champion jockey admitted he went into the final two rides of his career with a heavy heart . Retiring jockey McCoy insists he will never return to professional racing after his Sandown farewell . Dame Judi Dench, Actress: 'A winner. He’s a winner. I can’t imagine how he is going to feel, I must say, retiring from having such a kind of glittering career. He was born to ride a horse, he was born to win too. It’s wonderful to meet him and be able to say to him, you’re a legend.' Ian Wright, who presented the Champions Jockey trophy McCoy said: 'AP McCoy is made of something else altogether. For 20 years he has been at the top of his game, riding winners, week in week out. I can think of no other sportsman or woman who can match his record. Like the Arsenal team of 2003/04 he’s proven that he truly is an Invincible. It was an incredible honour to award him with his trophy for the final time on the day he retires.' Trainer Jonjo O’Neill, who : 'He’s a brilliant all-rounder. He was the one man out there you didn’t want riding against you. I was lucky to get a lot of use out of him – more than anybody else. He’s fantastic on the lesser horses and he gets just as much of a kick out of winning a selling plate race as he does the Gold Cup. He gives it the same ride, that’s why he’s very special.' JP McManus, Racehorse Owner and long-standing employer: 'I get enormous pleasure from AP riding. If he is on one of my horses then it’s a bonus but if it’s somebody else’s I still get a thrill out of it. We’ve had many great days winning the Grand National and a Gold Cup. There’s never a right time [to retire], but it’s nice that he’s picking a time of his choosing. He’s an ironman and a lovely man. I’ve grown to love him more and more, as my family have. There’s something deep and great about him.' Tony McCoy signs autographs for punters on his final-ever day as a jockey at Sandown .

However, the midfielder has once again not been fined after the Liverpool boss spoke to him as well as Ibe on Thursday and the club insist the case is now closed. Brendan Rodgers has met with Sterling to remind him of his professional responsibilities at Liverpool . Rodgers and Sterling were locked in discussions at the Melwood training ground on Friday . Liverpool players Raheem Sterling and Jordon Ibe have been pictured holding a shisha pipe . This is the second time Sterling has been pictured with a shisha pipe in the last week . Jordon Ibe has also been warned by Rodgers after the youngster was pictured alongside Sterling . Sterling, 20, and Ibe, 19, were pictured during what is believed to be a visit to a shisha cafe in London earlier this season. Sterling met Liverpool manager Rodgers and he was reminded of his professional responsibilities and warned about the consequences of taking a drug that has been called ‘hippy crack’. It has been a controversial week for Sterling, who has 14 caps for England, all coming in the wake of his interview with the BBC in which he revealed why he had rejected a £100,000-a-week deal at Liverpool. Several clubs, including Arsenal, have withdrawn their interest in the midfielder in the light of recent images. Sterling is all smiles during training as he completes a sprinting drill alongside Philippe Coutinho . It appears that Sterling and Ibe each have a shisha pipe and are also drinking Fanta . Sterling was pictured on social media smoking a shisha pipe in a story published over the weekend . Sterling was also filmed apparently inhaling nitrous oxide - known as 'hippy crack' Rodgers questioned Sterling’s professionalism on Monday after footage emerged of the 20-year-old unconscious in his house in Southport having taken nitrous oxide with two unnamed friends, but has yet to speak publicly about the pictures with Ibe. They are believed to have been taken last September, and both are seen smiling and joking as they hold on to the pipes in the bar. Liverpool offered no comment on those photos and the club maintained the matter would be dealt with internally. Sterling is expected to line up in the FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa at Wembley on Sunday. Sterling celebrates with Ibe after he opened the scoring against Newcastle in the Premier League on Monday .",

As we know, the Premier League has the money and prestige, but what the FA Cup has is history, and boy does the BBC love a bit of history? Lest you were in any doubt, its coverage of the semi-final kicked off with footage of the late Sir Laurence Olivier doing the St Crispin's Day speech from the film of Henry V ('We happy few, We band of brothers,' and so on).

In such instances, the BBC is lucky to retain the services of Gary Lineker, the best presenter of live football on TV. Sky have never really replaced the disgraced Richard Keys, who had the benefit of longevity in the post. The BBC needs to fight hard to avoid Lineker falling into the hands of rivals. Not that Sky's presenters are less than competent — David Jones did the job — but it's never a good sign when you have to go to Google to check which one it is. The price of live Premier League football is now way beyond the reach of the BBC, which may be the clincher in Lineker's future. While the BBC's match had the lion's share of the goalmouth action, it was difficult to resist turning over to Sky on occasion. Having invested its billions in the Premier League, Sky doesn't skimp on the peripheries. The sound always seems a little crisper, and in punditry, where Sky offers us the Rolls Royce of analysts, Gary Neville, the BBC counters with the mid-range Danny Murphy.

The man on the job on Saturday, Steve Wilson, is unfussy and made the most of what was the bigger story. The outcome on Sky was depressingly predictable.

    "source": "Radar images from Europe's Sentinel-1a satellite have revealed the aftermath of the Nepal earthquake in unrivalled detail. The information from the satellites has been transformed into an interferogram, which provides a colourful and highly detailed view of the Earth's land mass. By comparing before and after images, scientists have discovered Mount Everest shrank by about one inch due to the land that was shaken in the natural disaster. The tallest point in the world, however, still stands at 29,029 feet, according to The Weather Channel. Additionally, an area 75 miles (120km) by 30 miles (50km) has lifted up 3.2ft (1 metre) from the ground around the capital, Kathmandu. Interferogram over Kathmandu, Nepal, generated from two Sentinel-1A scans on 17 and 29 April 2015 – before and after the 25 April earthquake. Each ‘fringe’ of colour represents about 3cm of deformation. The large amount of fringes indicates a large deformation pattern of 3.2ft (1 metre) from the ground around Kathmandu . Scene: A rescue chopper prepares to land, evacuating climbers from higher camps to Everest Base Camp, Nepal. New radar images have shown that Mount Everest shrank one inch following the Nepal earthquake this week . These are the first radar images to reveal the destruction caused by the 7-magnitude earthquake that killed 5,000 people and affected millions more. 'There's a peak of slip just to the northeast of Kathmandu,' Professor Tim Wright from the Natural Environment Research Council told the BBC. He explained that what scientists count are the coloured 'fringes' in the interferogram, of which there are about 34 from this quake. This translates to more than 3.2ft (1 metre) of uplift. To the north of Kathmandu, the interferogram suggests that the ground receded, and it also shows how a fault ruptured east from the epicentre, but did not break the surface. Combining two Sentinel-1A radar scans from 17 and 29 April 2015, this interferogram shows changes on the ground that occurred during the 25 April earthquake that struck Nepal. An overall area of 120x100 km has moved – half of that uplifted and the other half, north of Kathmandu subsided. Vertical accuracy is a few centimetres . Sentinel-1A interferogram over Kathmandu, Nepal, showing deformation induced by the 25 April 2015 earthquake. East–west ‘fringes’ cross the city, with each coloured fringe corresponding to 2.8 cm of ground displacement (both uplift and subsidence). The interferogram combines two Sentinel-1A images from 17 and 29 April 2015 . Launch: 3 April 2014  French Guiana . Life: Minimum of seven years . Mass: 2300 kg (5070 lbs) Dimensions: 9.2ft (2.8m) long, 8.2ft (2.5m) wide, 13ft (4m) high . Mission: Monitoring sea ice, oil spills, winds and waves, land-use change and to respond to emergencies such as floods and earthquakes . How it works: Radar works by sending out radio waves and timing how long it takes for them to reflect back. The satellite uses a technique called 'Synthetic aperture radar interferometry'. Two or more satellite radar images of the same area are combined to detect large-scale changes. Small changes on the ground modify the reflected radar signal and lead to rainbow-coloured fringes in the 'interferogram'. Professor Wright says this suggests not all the strain in the rocks before the earthquake was released in during the catastrophic event. Sentinel-1A's swath width of 155 miles (250km) over land surfaces has allowed for an unprecedented area size to be analysed from a single scan. Scientists say the entire area will be covered under the same geometry every 12 days, allowing for the wider region to be regularly monitored for changes in the land. Its ability to 'see' through cloud and rain and in pitch darkness make it particularly useful for monitoring earthquakes and for offering images for emergency response. This is because it uses radar which works by sending out radio waves and timing how long it takes for them to reflect back. Radio waves travel through air virtually unimpeded, but materials like metal, rock and water act almost as mirrors which can help reveal those areas inundated by floods. It also makes no different to radar if the Earth is in darkness. Sentinel-1A is the first satellite for the Copernicus environment-monitoring programme led by the European Commission. The Copernicus EMS was activated on the day the earthquake struck, prompting Esa to begin collecting satellite imagery, which is being made available to support relief efforts. In parallel, the International Charter Space and Major Disasters was activated by India, China and the UN. Meanwhile, Nasa has posted its own images of the earthquake providing much less detail due to cloud cover. 'While we regularly post imagery of natural hazards, the weather and the satellites haven't cooperated in this case,' the space agency wrote in a blog. 'The orbital track of the satellites and the specific capabilities of the sensors on board determine whether we have imagery to share. In the case of Nepal, things haven't lined up in our favour.' The satellite imagery is used to create maps to support relief efforts, such as this ‘grading map’ of Kathmandu showing topographic features and crisis information. The red squares show road blockss, the green people markers show crowds, red dots are areas that are destroyed and yellow dots are areas that are possibly affected. The yellow lines mark out primary roads in the area . Sentinel-1 carries a radar that works in several specialised modes to provide detailed imagery (artist's impression left). The data will be used for applications such as monitoring the oceans, including shipping lanes, sea ice and oil spills. It also provides data to map changing land cover and deformations such as those produced by Saturday's devastating Earthquake in Nepal (right) Mount Everest before and after the earthquake. Not much change is visible because of a fresh coat of snow and cloud cover. The April 23 image was acquired by the Operational Land Imager on Landsat 8 . Nasa has posted its own images of the earthquake providing much less detail due to cloud cover. 'While we regularly post imagery of natural hazards, the weather and the satellites haven't cooperated in this case,' the space agency wrote in a blog .",

    "source": "A mother-of-two has been jailed after stealing almost £80,000 from her dying parents to go on shopping sprees - leaving her elderly father in debt and too poor to afford a telephone. Christine Lillico, 47, from  Heddon-on-the-Wall, Northumberland, was trusted with looking after her elderly parents' bank accounts as their health deteriorated with age. But instead of using the money to care for John and Audrey Air she plundered their life savings to bankroll her own lifestyle. Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) heard mother-of-two Christine Lillico, 47 was supposed to look after her elderly parents' bank accounts - but instead stole almost £80,000 from them over a six year period . By the time her fraud was discovered Lillico had stolen a total of £78,000. Newcastle Crown Court heard in the last months of his life Mr Air went without a telephone and basic amenities, while suffering the shame of being in debt for the first time in his life because of his daughter's crimes. A judge has now sent Lillico to jail and ordered she pay her brother John Air junior £39,000 - which would have been his inheritance has she not stolen it. Sentencing her to 20 months behind bars, Mr Recorder Baird said: 'You were trusted by your parents to look after them in their elderly years. 'They had modest savings which had taken all their lives to accumulate through hard work. 'Over a period of six years you plundered those savings. 'The result of that was when your father died in 2014 he was in debt, something he had never been in before and that is something that caused him great distress.' The court heard Lillico spent some of the £78,000 on shopping sprees in B&Q (file image) Christopher Knox, prosecuting, explained how Mr and Mrs Air, from Ashington, had both worked in the coal industry and had pensions. The couple gave their daughter control of their bank accounts after they sold their home for £95,000 and moved in to a sheltered flat, as their health began to fail as they grew older. 'The couple lived very sensibly,' said Mr Knox. 'By 2008 there was at least £55,000 in a savings account.' The court heard Mrs Air, who had suffered from dementia, passed away in October 2010 and Mr Air died in July 2014. But the court heard Lillico had been raiding her parents' accounts since 2008. Debit card transactions were made at various shops including JD Sports and B&Q. The accounts had also been used to pay for photography services and to buy an XBox and cash was also withdrawn from the banks and cheques written. The court heard Lillico is of previous good character. She pleaded guilty to three charges of fraud. It was calculated the amount of money Lillico stole amounted to what she and her brother would have inherited between them. The judge made an order under the Proceeds of Crime Act that she repay the half she owes within six months. Nigel Hedley, defending, said Lillico was hit by financial problems after a difficult divorce. 'She was a woman of good character. She had a very traumatic divorce and encountered severe financial difficulties.' He also said Lillico had been suspended from her job as a medical secretary as a result of her crimes, but that she would be able to pay her brother the money she owed by re-mortgaging her house.",

But instead of using the money to care for John and Audrey Air she plundered their life savings to bankroll her own lifestyle. Newcastle Crown Court heard mother-of-two Christine Lillico, 47 was supposed to look after her elderly parents' bank accounts - but instead stole almost £80,000 from them over a six year period. By the time her fraud was discovered Lillico had stolen a total of £78,000. Sentencing her to 20 months behind bars, Mr Recorder Baird said: 'You were trusted by your parents to look after them in their elderly years.'",

    "source": "This is the terrifying moment that one wrong move sent a climber tumbling 10 metres down an icy cliff face. Karlis Bardelis, 30, from Latvia, was attempting to scale the cliff in Coire an Lochain, Scotland, when the accident happened. And footage from a camera mounted to his helmet shows the very second that his climbing axe came loose. Mr Berdalis said: 'I was just thinking \"I hope I land somewhere soft and don't break any bones\".' Scroll down for video . The footage shows climber Karlis Bardelis carefully traversing the ridge, left, but one wrong move sends him tumbling down the icy cliff face in Coire an Lochain, Scotland, right . You see his feet literally above his head as he continues to fall down the mountain head-first . Karlis Bardelis, left, and Gary Kinsey, right, on Headhunter's summit on January 28, 2012. Bardelis has only just released the footage of his terrifying fall on a training exercise in hospital . Between 0.12 and 0.20 seconds in the video below, you can see the axe slipping out of the ice and knocking his other axe out of position. Almost immediately his feet were in the air and Karlis can see nothing but his boots and the blue sky as he begins the terrifying fall down the 60m mountain. He continues to fall for three-and-a-half seconds until he's eventually saved by his safety rope after falling ten metres. But the experienced Latvian climber, who now works in Nepal, held his nerve after the tumble and even continued his ascent to the top. Bardelis scaling the mountain which he fell from. On the left you can see the safety rope that saved his life . Holding his nerve: The experienced climber grips the rock face on his ascent . He said: 'My ropes saved me and stopped my fall. 'These kind of falls are very dangerous because I'm carrying two ice tools and crampons, both of which are really sharp and could cause serious injuries. 'Obviously there's the risk of hitting a rock on my way down, which can cause serious fractures. 'I never think that I'm going to die in these situations - I never consider death as an option' Karlis had travelled to Scotland to take part in a training course organised by the British Mountaineering Council joining climbers from 26 countries. And he attempted the level six climb with some trepidation. Life on the line: Bardelis was rescued by his safety rope after his axe became dislodged from the ice, knocking the other out of position and sending him plunging down the mountain . He said: 'I was feeling excited about that climb but at the same time I was feeling scared in those difficult parts too. 'I fell because I made a mistake; I put one ice axe in a crack and was trying to put another one in but the placement wasn't good so it ripped the other one out. 'My crampons weren't in a stable place so I fell.' The footage shows Karlis tumble backwards from the cliff face and free fall towards the ground. Incredibly, after being saved by his harness, Karlis continued his ascent after the fall. He said: 'I climbed back to the same place and this time did it right using the same technique. 'Some people laugh when they see the video - others say they are not going to sleep after seeing it. 'I guess it was a good example of how not to climb.' Top class: The Latvian is an experience climber who now works in Nepal. When he began falling, all he could dow was hope that he landed somewhere soft and didn't break any bones, he said .",

The electrifying winger has dazzled for the Eagles since Alan Pardew took over in January and has been watched by Liverpool and Newcastle this season. Bolasie has the opportunity to shine against Manchester City on Monday night and his manager - who was firm in the stance that it would take astronomical money to tempt Palace into selling - wants the 25-year-old to continue honing his skills at Selhurst Park. Crystal Palace are convinced Yannick Bolasie will learn from Wilfried Zaha’s mistakes and not jump ship . Electrifying winger has dazzled for the Eagles since Alan Pardew took over the club in January . ‘If he is going to go, he’s going to have to for a lot of money,’ Pardew said. ‘I think Yannick knows he needs to develop more to go to a top club. I actually think top clubs probably appreciate that.’ Zaha made the £10million switch to Manchester United two seasons ago but managed just two Premier League starts under David Moyes and sealed a permanent move back home this February after impressing on loan. Many point towards Zaha’s troubling spell in the north-west as serving only to curb his development, and Pardew believes last week’s announcement of post-tax profits of £17m means Bolasie will stay in south London when clubs inevitably come knocking this summer. He has two years to run on his contract. Zaha made just four appearances for Manchester United in two years with the club . Louis Van Gaal told Zaha he wasn't part of his plans after Capital One Cup snub . ‘He is a player who can change games and it brings unbelievable value to him. It’ll have to be a very, very big fee trust me,’ Pardew added. ‘The club is on a great financial footing. We are trying not just to improve the team but the facilities. It is not just the stadium but here at the training ground and grow the club as quickly as we can. ‘We have got a good base of players here and three or four additions to the group in the summer, we could be strong candidates for the top ten.’ Pardew admits it would have to take a very, very big fee to lure Bolasie away from Selhurst Park .",

The 68-year-old Pulaski County resident, who was known as Terrill Wayne Newman until Tuesday, told the Lexington Herald-Leader he doesn't expect to be elected but hopes the gesture will 'warm Galbraith's grave.' His predecessor, who died in 2012 from chronic emphysema, gained a following for his wit, sharp dress sense and support of legalizing marijuana. Terrill Wayne Newman (right), who is vying to become Governor of Kentucky, has legally changed his name to Gatewood Galbraith after the late local celebrity (left) who bid five times for the title but never won . The newly-christened Galbraith filed paperwork on Wednesday to run as an independent for the state's highest office. The Secretary of State's office says independent candidates must obtain 5,000 signatures from registered voters by August 11 to get their names on the general election ballot. Galbraith said he'll run on a similar platform, but will focus on his namesake. 'I mostly will be talking about the great Gatewood Galbraith,' he said. Galbraith says he and the late Galbraith were 'not friends per se,' but they shared mutual friends and knew each other on a first-name basis. Dea Riley, who was the original Galbraith's running mate in 2011, said she thinks he would find the whole name change amusing. 'I can hear him now: \"I'll tell the IRS to send him the tax bill,\"' Riley said. But she also said the new Galbraith 'has very big shoes to fill' with his name and she hopes he will honor it. 'To have Gatewood's name and message prostituted, for the sake to garner political office, is a personal affront to me in that I was not only his running mate but equally his friend and confidant,' Riley said.",

    "source": "Masters champion Jordan Spieth is back to work this week at the RBC Heritage Classic after two days celebrating his victory at Augusta National and being showered with attention. Spieth arrived at Sea Pines Resort late Tuesday night after a media whirlwind in New York since tying Tiger Woods' Masters record of 18-under 270 to capture the green jacket. The 21-year-old said it was a dizzying stretch with 26 appearances and interviews in 25 hours. 'It was a little crazy in New York having paparazzi know where we were going to eat dinner even though we never told anybody,' Spieth said Wednesday. Spieth doesn't believe the success will change him. In fact, he said he upheld his commitment to the RBC Heritage in part to chase down Rory McIlroy for world No. 1. 'I wouldn't come to a tournament just to come to a tournament, especially with that goal still in mind,' said Spieth, who moved to No. 2 in the world rankings with the Masters' win. Jordan Spieth returns to golf just days after winning the Masters and will play in the RBC Heritage Classic . Spieth has had two victories and two runner-up finishes in his past four events. He would have liked to have had his normal pre-tournament preparations at Harbour Town Golf Links. Instead, he'll go into his first-round tee time Thursday not having played a hole of practice on the tricky, Pete Dye-designed layout. 'I'm sure Jordan's wiped,' said Kevin Streelman, the Par-3 contest winner at Augusta National last week who finished tied for 12th behind Spieth. 'But he's 21 years old, he can handle it.' Spieth has had success here the previous two years, finishing ninth in 2013 and 12th last year. The RBC Heritage gave him an invite two years ago when Spieth was a rising, yet largely unknown 19 -year-old trying to make his way on tour. The top-10 finish, Spieth said, helped his confidence and status on the PGA Tour. 'This tournament helped with job security,' Spieth said. 'So it's a tournament that's close to me and I love it here.' The 21-year-old was in formidable form at Augusta and equaled Tiger Woods' tournament birdie record . Most Masters champions - and many of the game's best players - take the next week off after a pressure-packed week at Augusta National. Spieth heads a group of five ranked in the top 20 of the world (No. 10 Jim Furyk, No. 14 Patrick Reed, No. 17 Matt Kuchar and No. 19 Billy Horschel are the others) to compete this week. Streelman enjoys playing right after a major, knowing his game is honed in and peaking after a Grand Slam event. 'Your game is really primed and amped up,' he said. 'I'm very prepared.' Kuchar is the tournament's defending champion, holing out from a green-side bunker on the 72nd hole to defeat Luke Donald by a stroke. Spieth's success has him atop the FedEx Cup standings, the youngest player ever to lead that category. Spieth celebrates after putting the winning hole and winning the Masters at such a young age . There have only been two Masters winners the past 15 years to follow up their victories by playing Harbour Town. Vijay Singh tied for third here in 2000 a week after winning the Masters while Zach Johnson was sixth in 2007. Only Bernhard Langer is 1985 followed a Masters victory with a triumph a week later at the RBC Heritage. Spieth believes he'll be the same driven, focused competitor he's always been after winning the major he dreamed of as a child. That might be difficult after this week's spotlight. Spieth got congratulatory Tweets from stars like Oklahoma City's Kevin Durant and about 200 texts and emails since the victory. 'Given some time, that will subside a little bit,' he said. What won't ease up, Spieth said, is his desire to achieve the very best in golf, a quest that continues at Harbour Town. 'I was very much looking forward to getting back here, getting on solid ground and taking a deep breath,' Spieth said. 'I'm really looking forward to this week.'",

Speaking in the documentary Jason Robinson: Sports Life Stories, which will be broadcast on ITV4 at 10pm on Tuesday, the 40-year-old former dual-code international admitted he had been a heavy drinker during his early days at rugby league club Wigan, which almost led to his downfall. Robinson, who scored for England in the 2003 World Cup final victory against Australia, said: 'I got into a situation where I was drinking sometimes six nights a week. Former England ace Jason Robinson, pictured in 2007,  has revealed he contemplated committed suicide . Robinson played a key role in England's 2003 World Cup win against Australia in Sydney . 'Monday it was Wakefield, 10 pence a pint night. Tuesday I would be over to Liverpool, Wednesday it would be Oldham. Thursday it would be Wigan. And after the game we would go out wherever.' However, it was his arrest for affray, assault and criminal damage which left him considering an attempt on his own life and he credits then team-mate and Samoa star Va'aiga Tuigamala with turning things around. 'I can remember I just sat in my bedroom with an old knife, an old meat cleaver,' he recalled. 'I didn't want life to go on in this way. That night when I contemplated doing it, I wept like a baby. 'Had it not been for him (Tuigamala), coming into the environment I was in and putting a different slant on it, I certainly wouldn't have the hope that I've got now. And hope is something that people can't take away.' Former team-mate Va'aiga Tuigamala (right) convinced Robinson out of committing suicide . Robinson, pictured with Ben Cohen, has said 'nothing will compare to winning the World Cup in Australia' Robinson, who enjoyed immense success before switching codes in 2000, also looks back on England's World Cup win as the pinnacle of his 20-year playing career. 'When you look at the emotion on those players' faces, it was the reality and the relief that we have just won a World Cup,' he said. 'And I will never forget that. Jumping on Will Greenwood's back. Hugging Lawrence Dallaglio. All the hard work. Everything we've done has been for this moment. 'Nothing will ever compare to winning the World Cup, and especially in the backyard of Australia.'",

'I got into a situation where I was drinking sometimes six nights a week. Monday it was Wakefield, 10 pence a pint night. Tuesday I would be over to Liverpool, Wednesday it would be Oldham. Thursday it would be Wigan. And after the game we would go out wherever.'",

    "source": "Veterinarians have criticised EU rules on organic farming that demands that fish are treated with homoeopathic remedies. In line with EU regulations, the first line of treatment for organic fish should be 'substances from plants, animals or minerals in a homeopathic dilution', before . British and Norwegian vets have called the directives 'scientifically illiterate', saying that the use of homeopathy could lead to 'serious animal health and welfare detriment.' 'Risk': Under EU regulations, organic farmers must first use 'substances from plants, animals or minerals in a homeopathic dilution' to treat ill fish, which has been criticised by British and Norwegian vets (stock image) The directives, outlined in the 2009 European regulation on organic aquaculture, are set to be brought into national law in non-EU Norway, which has caused vets to see red. Section 7 of the regulations calls for organic farmers to use 'substances from plants, animals or minerals in a homoeopathic dilution', as their first port of call when their fish are ill . After this, the 'veterinary treatments' section outlines that farmers may use  'plants and their extracts not having anaesthetic effects'. As well as the directive to use homeopathic treatments, organic fish farmers are only allowed to resort to mainstream medical treatments a maximum of twice per year, or their fish will lose its organic certification. This has been criticised by the  Norwegian Veterinary Association (NVA) as could mean that fish are not getting the correct treatment in time, causing them unnecessary suffering. Danger: British and Norwegian vets have called the EU directives on organic fish treatment 'scientifically illiterate', saying that the use of homeopathy could lead to 'serious animal health and welfare detriment' 'We think it's totally unacceptable from a scientific point of view because there's no scientific basis for using homeopathy,' Ellef Blakstad, the head of the Norwegian Veterinary Association, told The Local.no. 'If you start using homeopathy, you prolong the time when the animals are not getting adequate treatment and that's a threat to animal welfare.' Harsh: Farmers are only allowed to use mainstream medical treatments a twice per year, or their fish will lose its organic certification (stock image) The criticism from Norway has been echoed by the British Veterinary Association, saying use of homeopathy could lead to 'serious animal health and welfare detriment.' The British Veterinary Association (BVA) cannot endorse the use of homeopathic remedies, or indeed any products, making therapeutic claims, which have no proven efficacy,' British Veterinary Association President John Blackwell told MailOnline. 'As with any treatment for disease using medicines, BVA believes that veterinary medicinal products must be evidence-based, with any medicinal claims made by a manufacturer supported. 'If homeopathic remedies are used without proven effectiveness on farmed fish across the EU, including the UK, the consequence could be serious animal health and welfare detriment, which would be counterproductive to both animal health and to the farmed fish industry in the UK.' Homepathic treatments are based on the principle that 'like cures like', whereby a highly diluted substance that causes the symptoms  in a healthy person, can also cure similar symptoms in a sick person. A 2010 House of Commons Science and Technology Committee report on homeopathy said that homeopathic remedies perform no better than placebos, and that the principles on which homeopathy is based are 'scientifically implausible'.",

British and Norwegian vets have called the directives 'scientifically illiterate', saying that the use of homeopathy could lead to 'serious animal health and welfare detriment.' Under EU regulations, organic farmers must first use 'substances from plants, animals or minerals in a homeopathic dilution' to treat ill fish. After this, farmers may use 'plants and their extracts not having anaesthetic effects'. Organic fish farmers are only allowed to resort to mainstream medical treatments a maximum of twice per year, or their fish will lose its organic certification.",

    "source": "Things haven't been going well for Manchester United flop Anderson since he left Old Trafford to return to Brazil, but at least on Wednesday his own errors were outshone by the stupidity of a team-mate. The Brazilian midfielder was sent off for Internacional after a first-half off-the-ball shove on Ypiranga Erechim striker Otacilio Neto that also saw his opponent sent off for retaliating with an elbow. But fortunately for Anderson, his colleague Fabricio stole the limelight by swearing at his own fans and becoming the third player to be shown the red card, reducing Internacional to nine men in the 1-1 draw in Porto Alegre. Former Manchester United midfielder Anderson shoved Otacilio Neto off the ball to earn a red card . Neto also saw red after he retaliated by by appearing to aim an elbow at Anderson in Porto Alegre . The two players listen to the referee as he reaches for his card from his back pocket on Wednesday night . Anderson shows his shock to be shown the red card for what he believed to be an innocent challenge . While some players offered their hands in apology to the fans after being repeatedly booed, Fabricio took a different route and showed two middle fingers to the crowd leaving referee Luis Teixeira Rocha with no choice but to give him his marching orders. The 28-year-old left back reacted by tearing off his shirt, throwing it to the floor and shouting 'I'm leaving, I'm leaving,' as he walked down the tunnel. He has already been suspended until the end of the week by his club. Anderson ended his seven-and-a-half year association with United in February by signing a four-year deal with Internacional, but his return to Brazil has not gone as planned. Internacional's Fabricio was also sent off later in the game for aiming his middle fingers at booing fans . Fabricio threw his shirt to the ground after being shown the red card and shouted 'I'm leaving, I'm leaving' Having missed a penalty on his debut, he was substituted later in February after just 36 minutes needing oxygen while playing in the high-altitude Estadio Hernando Siles in La Paz. While Internacional sit top of the table in the Campeonato Gaucho, Anderson has faced a familiar struggle for fitness despite making eight appearances since his move. Anderson ended a miserable seven-and-a-half year spell with Manchester United by leaving this season .",

While some players offered their hands in apology to the fans after being repeatedly booed, Fabricio took a different route and showed two middle fingers to the crowd leaving referee Luis Teixeira Rocha with no choice but to give him his marching orders. The 28-year-old left back reacted by tearing off his shirt, throwing it to the floor and shouting 'I'm leaving, I'm leaving,' as he walked down the tunnel.

    "source": "A Texas state trooper who did what millions of hip-hop fans would love to do and posed for a picture with Snoop Dogg was told he has ''deficiencies indicating need for counseling'. Department of Public Safety trooper Billy Spears posed for the photograph with Snoop at South by Southwest in Austin after the rap icon delivered his keynote speech. Spears, who is based out of the state's Gilmer office, posed for the photo at the rapper's request. Scroll down for video . Department of Public Safety trooper Billy Spears (left) was disciplined last week for posing with Snoop Dogg . Snoop requested the photo at South by Southwest in Austin after the rap icon delivered his keynote speech . Spears' bosses called Snoop a figure who has a 'criminal background including numerous drug charges' After his publicist took the photo, Snoop - whose real name is Calvin Broadus - posted it to Instagram with the caption: 'Me n my deputy dogg'. Spears' bosses at DPS saw the posting and then cited him, according to the Dallas Morning News. The official reprimand read: 'While working a secondary employment job, Trooper Spears took a photo with a public figure who has a well-known criminal background including numerous drug charges. 'The public figure posted the photo on social media and it reflects poorly on the Agency.' The counseling advised Spears to say no when people ask for a picture with him. Snoop has convictions for drug possession and stood trial for murder in 1993 before being acquitted. Since Spears was only reprimanded with counseling, DPS does not view the penalty as a formal disciplinary action and the trooper cannot appeal. DPS spokesman Tom Vinger said on Wednesday: 'DPS does not typically discuss or release specifics of personnel issues unless they result in disciplinary action as outlined in Government Code 411.00755 and 411.0072. 'Supervisors counsel and coach employees on a regular basis, and these efforts do not constitute formal discipline by the department.' The counseling advised Spears to say no when people ask for a picture with him but that's about it . Attorney Ty Clevenger is representing Spears and covering the case on his blog. He wrote: 'DPS claims that the counseling forms are not really discipline, therefore the employee has no right to appeal. 'Yet those counseling incidents can block a trooper’s chances for promotion or advancement. 'So it appears that DPS commanders are papering Billy’s file with counseling incidents because they can’t prove that he violated any law, order, or policy, and they know that he will beat them with the law and the facts if he is given an opportunity to appeal.' Clevenger is calling public attention to the situation and has written letters to officials at DPS. It seems the Department of Public Safety has a problem with Snoop but Austin police seem okay with him .",

Department of Public Safety trooper Billy Spears posed for the photograph with Snoop at South by Southwest in Austin after the rap icon delivered his keynote speech. Spears, who is based out of the state's Gilmer office, posed for the photo at the rapper's request. Scroll down for video . Department of Public Safety trooper Billy Spears (left) was disciplined last week for posing with Snoop Dogg . Snoop requested the photo at South by Southwest in Austin after the rap icon delivered his keynote speech . Spears' bosses called Snoop a figure who has a 'criminal background including numerous drug charges' After his publicist took the photo, Snoop - whose real name is Calvin Broadus - posted it to Instagram with the caption: 'Me n my deputy dogg'. Spears' bosses at DPS saw the posting and then cited him, according to the Dallas Morning News. The official reprimand read: 'While working a secondary employment job, Trooper Spears took a photo with a public figure who has a well-known criminal background including numerous drug charges. 'The public figure posted the photo on social media and it reflects poorly on the Agency.' The counseling advised Spears to say no when people ask for a picture with him. Snoop has convictions for drug possession and stood trial for murder in 1993 before being acquitted. Since Spears was only reprimanded with counseling, DPS does not view the penalty as a formal disciplinary action and the trooper cannot appeal. DPS spokesman Tom Vinger said on Wednesday: 'DPS does not typically discuss or release specifics of personnel issues unless they result in disciplinary action as outlined in Government Code 411.00755 and 411.0072. 'Supervisors counsel and coach employees on a regular basis, and these efforts do not constitute formal discipline by the department.' The counseling advised Spears to say no when people ask for a picture with him but that's about it . Attorney Ty Clevenger is representing Spears and covering the case on his blog. He wrote: 'DPS claims that the counseling forms are not really discipline, therefore the employee has no right to appeal. 'Yet those counseling incidents can block a trooper’s chances for promotion or advancement. 'So it appears that DPS commanders are papering Billy’s file with counseling incidents because they can’t prove that he violated any law, order, or policy, and they know that he will beat them with the law and the facts if he is given an opportunity to appeal.' Clevenger is calling public attention to the situation and has written letters to officials at DPS. It seems the Department of Public Safety has a problem with Snoop but Austin police seem okay with him .",

    "source": "Standing in a public shower cubicle with my screaming 15-month-old son, I was starting to wonder whether I truly was a Keycamp type of person. My hazy memories of similar family holidays as a child were of slow days spent on pine-scented campsites, punctuated by trips to sun-soaked beaches. But here I was, a fully-fledged father, some quarter of a century later wondering what had gone wrong. Our journey to Argeles-sur-Mer on France’s Mediterranean coast went without a hitch, despite being in the minority of travellers flying, then hiring a car, rather than driving all the way. But the fatal decision was to try and wash the children, toddler Joe and five-year-old Anna, after arriving in a tired and tetchy state at Camping La Chapelle. Chris Greenwood stayed at Camping La Chappelle with his wife, Catherine, and children, Joe and Anna . Families congregated around the pools every afternoon for relief from the August heat . It was at this point I discovered that we didn’t have any hot water and the baby bath had a big hole in the bottom and no plug. With stubborn determination I slung the youngest over my shoulder, grabbed some towels and trudged off to the shower block. Minutes later he had showed me the error of my ways in the way that only toddlers can. And this was something I was left to chew over, as we quickly realised neither stubbornness nor determination have a place in this land of dappled sunlight, flip-flops and fresh baguettes. The children spent plenty of time in the pool, playing with the many new friends they made . Joe wears oversized sunglasses while relaxing by the pool at Camping La Chappelle in Argeles-sur-Mer . Instead over the next 10 days we threw ourselves at the mercy of campsite life, simply taking the path of least resistance. With hindsight, we should, of course, on that first night have just thrown the children into bed – dirt and all – and gone swimming first thing. Eurocamp (which has since absorbed Keycamp under its banner), and its stable of mobile home accommodation, provide everything you need to make a great success of simple pleasures like these. Things have come on a long way since I was a foot shorter and my family holidayed every year in tents across the south-west of France. The Greenwood family made several trips to the pleasant Argeles beach with its mountain backdrop . Multiple swimming pools, a kids club, swings and a bakery kept the Greenwoods busy during their stay . Lugging jerry cans of water back to our tent with its zip-up compartments and constant procession of ants had its charm, but so does double-glazing, a fully-fitted kitchen and air conditioning. We stayed in a Vista three-bedroom mobile home. It’s not huge, the bedrooms have the feel of a ship cabin, but it’s all there. The shower is decent with plenty of hot water – once the boiler has been sparked into life by a handy courier – and you’ve got your own loo and a decent size fridge. Two sets of doors lead out on to a deck, equipped with a gas-fired barbecue and, in our case, a permanent al fresco bath for Joe. Camping La Chapelle's biggest selling point is a fantastic swimming pool complex, including two water slides . Eurocamp offer sites for all types and tastes, and Camping La Chapelle is probably quite typical of a modern French campsite. This is certainly not your isolated enclave where you spend the evening listening only to the cicadas and warm wind rustling through the trees. Instead, you are likely to be able to hear the distant sounds of a German murdering a 1980s pop classic at karaoke night at the bar. But it’s a trade-off if you want somewhere lively and family orientated, which this campsite certainly is. In La Chapelle’s case, the biggest selling point is the fantastic swimming pool complex, including two water slides. There is even a heated pool with a retractable roof, under which we spent a memorable afternoon sheltering from a thunderstorm that rolled in from the Pyrenees. Joe and Anne, pictured with dad Chris, enjoyed the kids club, run by a team of dedicated workers . Families congregated around the pools every afternoon for relief from the August heat and Anna became an almost permanent fixture in the water, playing with the many new friends she’d made on the site. So the pool became a mainstay of our pleasant daily routine, which began with picking up freshly baked bread from the campsite bakery and ended with drinks and snacks on the deck. We quickly made use of the kids club, run by a small team of dedicated and enthusiastic couriers. Four hours of varied entertainment is on offer for children aged five to 12, six days of the week, and during our stay those in charge worked hard to build a rapport with their young charges from Britain, Ireland, Germany and Holland. Chris and Catherine get into the spirit at Camping La Chappelle's campsite 'Olympics' for children . Anna enjoyed games, crafts and an X-Factor-style talent show as the club proved a hub for families staying with Keycamp and its sister company Eurocamp. The two tribes were ultimately set against each other with an evening campsite ‘Olympics’, at which I am sad to report Eurocamp cleaned up. But not before our children had soaked their couriers to the skin in a bizarre game involving body paint, shouting and many, many bottles of water. As the days went on we settled into a pleasant routine, padding about the site between the bakery, kids club, swings and swimming pools. We did venture off site most mornings, making the 10-minute walk to the pleasant Argeles beach with its mountain backdrop and host of accessible cafes, bars and a mini-supermarket. When the Greenwoods weren't in the pool they spent time on the beach in the stunning port of Collioure . A little further afield was the stunning port of Collioure, once a magnet for artists including Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso. It really is a picture postcard place, with a little bay and beach perfect for swimming, surrounded by traditional French cafes, restaurants and arts and crafts boutiques. We went back twice to make sure we hadn’t missed anything in its winding maze of pretty streets. Once my wife and I found a new rhythm we pretty much all agreed that we could be Keycamp kind of people. We vowed never to force Joe to take a shower ever again though – at least not until he is big enough to take himself. Chris and his family stayed at Camping La Chapelle, Argeles-Sur-Mer, for 10 nights with Keycamp (www.eurocamp.co.uk or 0844 406 0319), which now operates under the Eurocamp banner. Eurocamp offer self-catering holidays at more than 160 sites across Europe, including popular regions like the Dordogne, Holland and central Italy. From May 25, 2015, a seven-night stay in a two-bedroom Esprit mobile home at Camping La Chapelle starts at £427. Peak season flights with easyJet to Montpellier from Gatwick start at £65 each way, plus baggage. Chris hired a car with Europcar, which cost around £250 for 10 days, including two child seats and unlimited mileage.",

    "source": "(CNN)It sounds like the plot for a science fiction movie. Someone has a horrific accident and winds up in the hospital, brain dead and on life support. Doctors approach the family about organ donation, but instead of saving as many as eight lives, the family is asked to donate the whole body to save just one individual. Perhaps a quadriplegic with a mind that outmatches their malfunctioning body. As crazy as this sounds, to put an entire head on a new body, a human body, Italian physician Dr. Sergio Canavero says we are approaching  HEAVEN (an acronym for head anastomosis venture; anastomosis is surgically connecting two parts). The pieces are coming together but there are still many hurdles to jump. Canavero says he has part of the funding secured, although he says he can't yet disclose where the money is coming from as a condition of the funding. He's also taking the 2015 layman's approach with crowd funding and book sales. He has identified Valery Spiridonov as the first patient. The 30-year-old Russian man suffers from a rare genetic disorder called Werdnig-Hoffman disease. Canavero says the man volunteered. The two men have talked via Skype but they have yet to meet in person and Canavero has not reviewed Spiridonov's medical records. Canavero says he has a stack of emails and letters from people who want this procedure. Many of them are transsexuals who want a new body, he says. But he insists the first patients will be people who are suffering from a muscle wasting disease. Another big obstacle is the need for a partner. Canavero can't just do this in his own Frankenstein lab. He needs a major academic medical center to host this endeavor and he has his eyes set on the United States. He hopes to get a buy-in this summer when he presents his plan to the American Academy of Neurological and Orthopedic Surgeons, or AANOS, at its annual conference in June. He's counting on getting the green light he needs for the first human whole head transplant to take place in 2017. Nick Rebel, executive director of AANOS, says the group is not endorsing Canavero, it is simply giving him a platform to hear what he has to say. If Canavero doesn't get the support he needs in the United States, he'll look to China and his timeline will slide by a year. Once these pieces are in place, Canavero says he'll put together a staff of 150 nurses and doctors. Many of them, like the patient, are already identified because they've asked to be part of this team. Then they'll need to practice for what is anticipated to be a 36-hour operation. \"I say two years is the time needed for the team to reach perfect synchronization,\" Canavero speculates. But what about the science? Is such an idea even plausible? He says he has research that supports it. Canavero points to Dr. Robert White, who transplanted the head of one monkey to the body of another at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in 1970. The monkey died after eight days, because the body rejected the new head. Before ithe monkey died, it could not move because the spinal cord of the head and body were not connected. The monkey also was unable to breathe on its own. The paper in which Canavero outlined his procedure references a different 1971 experiment White conducted with six monkey heads, none of which survived more than 24 hours. But Canavero says advances in science and medicine since then eliminate the problems White faced. Dr. Hunt Batjer, chairman of neurological surgery at UT Southwestern and president-elect of the American Association for Neurological Surgeons, says White's research is not validation for a human head transplant. \"[It's] a 45-year-old reference in a primate and there is no evidence that the spinal cord was anastomosed functionally,\" he says. Batjer further explains that it's a great leap to go from brain survival of the surgery to restoring body function, which White did not look at. Canavero is confident in his writing and in conversation. He cites White's monkeys and even the success of German researchers who helped paralyzed rats walk, giving no pause to the fact that such research is more likely to go nowhere than to make it to human clinical trials. He published his paper in the free, online, medical journal Surgical Neurology International in 2013. He walks readers through a scenario, outlining the key points that will make this work, including cooling the spinal cord before severing it. Doing so with an ultra-sharp blade will avoid the damage experienced by spinal cord injury patients, he says. He'll use a \"magic ingredient\" as a sealant to fuse the spinal cord back together and offers a few options for what that ingredient could be. The nerves, having been color-coded when separated, will be carefully aligned and this will all be done very quickly because time is key. An impossibility, according to Batjer. He conceded that the airway, the spine, the major veins and arteries, can all be put back together, but the spinal cord is the problem. He says the result would be the inability to move or breathe. \"I would not wish this on anyone, I would not allow anyone to do it to me, there are a lot of things worse than death,\" Batjer says. The science isn't there to support this, says Arthur Caplan, Ph.D., director of medical ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center. He says it's nothing more than a big PR stunt, and calls Canavero \"nuts.\" Caplan says this has to be done in many animals before it's tried on humans. Caplan also points out that if Canavero can do this, he should first be helping paralyzed patients by fixing their spinal cords, before transplanting whole bodies. As for the patients, Caplan says, \"their bodies would end up being overwhelmed with different pathways and chemistry than they are used to and they'd go crazy.\" In his paper, Canavero says identity issues could be a problem as the head gets used to its new body. He also says pain could be a problem. As far as immunosuppression, Canavero points to today's transplant successes as evidence this is not a problem. Caplan isn't buying it. He's seen how difficult it is for his NYU colleagues who perform face transplants. The levels of anti-rejection medications required are so high they put patients at risk for cancer and kidney problems. He says it doesn't make sense that you'd poison a new body with immunosuppressant medications to make a head transplant work. Another issue Caplan has seen with face transplant patients is they don't always get full function of their new organ. \"It's not like you can unscrew your head and put it on someone else,\" Caplan says. Dr. Robert Ruff, the Veterans Affairs national director for neurology, calls it farfetched and farcical, not to mention unlikely to work. He says this is more like centuries away, not years. \"It would be impossible to predict that far into the future,\" Ruff says. Canavero insists, though, \"We can already do this.\"",

Ten-week-old Qingqing is currently in a critical condition in hospital in eastern China, following emergency surgery to repair her mauled face. Her mother told the People's Daily Online: ‘We left after our baby girl fell asleep. Who knew this would happen?' Recovering from surgery: Little Qingqing, who is just ten weeks old, has bandages around her damaged face . The woman, named only as Ms Li, said that on the day of the attack, she and her husband fed their daughter then went to work near their house in Haimen City, eastern China. But Ms Li could not stop thinking about her daughter so returned home after just ten minutes. When she arrived, a white dog with blood around its mouth came running towards her, she said. She dashed to the bedroom where she had left Qingqing - and discovered that the little girl had been dragged from her bed by the dog, which is believed to be a stray. Ms Li said: ‘I nearly fainted. My baby girl was lying face flat on the floor, with blood all over.' Distraught: Qingqing's mother, identified only as Ms Li, at her daughter's bedside in hospital . The right side of Qingqing's face had been shredded and her eyelid torn off. She was carried to a local clinic by her mother but her injuries were too severe to be treated there. She was then transferred to the larger Nantong City No.3 People’s Hospital, where she was operated on. She is recovering from the surgery but is suffering from a fever that is concerning her doctors. Her plastic surgeon, Dr Sun Jiyie, said: ‘This is the youngest child with the most severe injuries we have seen from a dog bite. ‘If she could safely power through the critical period, we will be planning more plastic surgery. But she is so young and the injuries are so severe, the operations will no doubt be very difficult.’ Mrs Li, who is keeping a vigil at her daughter's bedside, said she and her husband only recently moved to Haimen after working at a greenhouse farm in another province for three years. Disfigured: A pixellated photo of Qingqing's face before her surgical dressings were applied (right) Last night Dr Zhao Xianzhong, the director of the hospital's burns and plastic surgery department, reminded all parents never to leave their babies and children alone. He also issued a general warning about dogs - saying attacks in China are more common in spring and summer. The hospital currently treats around 20 people a day for dog bites but the figure is expected to increase in the coming weeks as temperatures rise. ‘When summer arrives, people wear less fabric, and dogs are only interested in exposed skin,' explained Dr Zhao. 'Girls should be more aware when they are wearing short skirts and shorts.’",

Ten-week-old Qingqing is currently in a critical condition in hospital in eastern China, following emergency surgery to repair her mauled face. Her mother told the People's Daily Online: 'We left after our baby girl fell asleep. Who knew this would happen?' The woman, named only as Ms Li, said that on the day of the attack, she and her husband fed their daughter then went to work near their house in Haimen City, eastern China. But Ms Li could not stop thinking about her daughter so returned home after just ten minutes. When she arrived, a white dog with blood around its mouth came running towards her, she said. She dashed to the bedroom where she had left Qingqing - and discovered that the little girl had been dragged from her bed by the dog, which is believed to be a stray.",

    "source": "Andy Murray tied the knot with Kim Sears on Saturday at Dunblane Cathedral, as thousands of fans waited outside to greet the couple. The tennis star, who announced his engagement in November last year, tied the knot in the 12th century cathedral before a relatively small group of their family members and close friends. Reverend Colin Renwick, led the service, was pictured outside the cathedral just after 3.00pm this afternoon with the wedding taking place at around 4.00pm. Andy Murray and his wife Kim are all smiles after tying the knot at Dunblane Cathedral . Kim shows her delight after marrying British tennis star Murray on Saturday afternoon . The happy couple are covered in confetti as they make their way out of the wedding ceremony . Murray waves to his fans after making his way out of the cathedral following his wedding . Hundreds of well-wishers gathered on the streets around the cathedral and one of the biggest cheer so far has been reserved for Judy Murray, who arrived just before 4.00pm looking resplendent in a white, to-the-knee overcoat with a detailed gold dress.The outfit was topped off with a dramatic gold hat. This morning, the historic cathedral saw florists toting huge bouquets of flowers arrive to decorate the church - as hailstones and showers battered the venue. Clearly unable to contain his excitement this morning, tennis ace Murray posted a tweet to his 2.98 million followers which shows his plans for the day - through the use of emojis. He tweeted an umbrella, a picture of a church, a ring, a kiss, cake, drinks including beer, cocktails and wine and ends with hearts, a face blowing a kiss and several Zzzz icons for sleep. Murray (left) and his brother Jamie Murray (second left) arrive for his wedding to Kim Sears . Murray waves to the crowd as he arrives for the wedding as does his mother Judy in Dunblane . Kim Sears arrives for her wedding to British tennis number one Andy at Dunblane Cathedral . Andy tweeted his plans for the day through the use of emojis and it would appear he's counting on plenty of laughter, kissing and alcohol . People continue to gather outside Dunblane Cathedral just hours before the wedding is due to start at 4.30pm . The forecast for the rest of the day isn't on the couple's side although there looks like being some respite from the rain between 3pm and 4pm as guests are expected to arrive. The heavens are likely to open again around 5pm. Andy's mother Judy discussed the bad weather on social media, initially tweeting: 'Hailstones. Marvellous,' and then a few hours later: 'Snowing. White wedding.' Fans who have set up camp outside the church have found themselves battling the elements this morning as they were battered by wind, rain and sleet in short succession. Ross Hutchins (left) was a guest at the ceremony, as was former British No 1 Tim Henman and his wife . However the wet weather showed no sign of dampening the spirits of the crowds outside the cathedral. Brenda Watson travelled from Ochiltree in Ayrshire with her friend to join in the celebrations. She said: 'We forgot our hats but we're hoping the sun will shine for Andy and Kim. We're so excited about seeing them and the atmosphere is great, it's been well worth coming.' Her friend Anne Gemmell from Stair in Ayrshire said Kim's dress might be 'something lacy and just chic.' No doubt the couple will both be hoping the weather improves before the ceremony later on today - or the guests could get soaked. Murray and his brother walk into the church as they begin preparations for his wedding to Kim Sears . Hundreds of the world's media are also in place to capture the event which has sparked interest around the globe. Murray took a moment out of his wedding preparations to chat on Twitter this morning about a pre-wedding snooker game last night. Tennis player Jamie Delgado tweeted: 'Pre-wedding snooker ended in another victory for guess who? Andy Murray, Rosco Hutchins, Johnny Delgado,' to which Murray replied: 'Jamie Delgado, Rosco Hutchins, Johnny Delgado, last night was actual carnage for those boys I couldn't believe it.' The reception is being held at the 15-bedroom Cromlix House Hotel, located just outside the town, which Andy bought two years ago for £1.9 million. Fans cheer as the British tennis number one Andy Murray arrives his wedding to fiance Kim Sears . Florists have been spotted working all morning to decorate the cathedral, wheeling in huge bouquets of white hydrangeas and full-sized cherry blossom trees. Hundreds of locals are expected to gather outside the cathedral to catch a glimpse of the pair who met as teenagers and have been together for more than nine years. The proud Perthshire community has spent the last few days decorating the high street with bunting in preparation for the celebration which will be reported around the globe. Murray fans have been posting their best wishes on social media and Scotland's First Minister has also offered her congratulations. Hibernian FC tweeted: 'Best wishes from everybody at #Hibs to our supporter @andy_murray on his wedding day; have a great time! First dance to Sunshine on Leith?' Murray said recently he will have three best men - his brother Jamie and friends Ross Hutchins and Carlos Mier. Sussex-born Sears, also 27, will have four bridesmaids but the style and design of her bridal gown has so far remained a secret. Several names from the world of tennis are likely to be on the guest list, with former British number one Tim Henman among those tipped to appear. Reports suggest Murray and Ms Sears had originally planned to marry at a chapel within the grounds of Cromlix House, which Murray purchased two years ago, but later opted for the 300-seat cathedral. The couple met in 2005 through tennis circles - her father Nigel is a coach and former head of women's tennis at the Lawn Tennis Association. They moved in together in 2008 and briefly split the following year before rekindling their relationship. Speculation about their engagement was fuelled by Murray who, responding to a fan's question on Twitter last year, joked that he would marry Ms Sears after Wimbledon. He was forced to point out that he was not serious but announced his engagement for real in November. Andy Murray's No 1 fans: Linda Reid-Nevitt, 62, and Amy Moffat, 15, from West Calder, wait outside of the cathedral ahead of the wedding . Murray told BBC Sport last month: 'I am actually not nervous about getting married because we've been together like nine-and-a-half years and we've lived together for six or seven years as well. 'So, I don't think a whole lot's going to change. I kind of feel like we have been married already in terms of the way we spend our lives together and live together. 'I think I will be more nervous about starting a family because that would be more life-changing, in a good way.' Yesterday the pair were spotted looking happy and relaxed as they arrived at the cathedral for their wedding rehearsal. Bride-to-be Kim, 27, wore skinny black jeans, a leather jacket and blue scarf as the final preparations were made for their big day. Hundreds of locals are expected to gather outside the cathedral to catch a glimpse of the pair who met as teenagers . Andy is a hero in his native town and the residents have pulled out all the stops to wish the happy couple well . Graham Fleming puts up bunting in Dunblane's high street as shops  decorate their fronts in support of local boy Andy . Perhaps saving her legs for walking in heels tomorrow, she today stayed casual in red flats. Meanwhile, a smiling Andy was equally casual in jeans and trainers as he made his way into the cathedral where he will make his vows this weekend. With an Olympic gold medal and Wimbledon title under his belt, Andy is a hero in his native town and the residents have pulled out all the stops to wish the happy couple well. The minister set to conduct the wedding ceremony said the whole town is excited as the event is 'the nearest we'll have in recent times to a royal wedding'. Reverend Colin Renwick said he expects Britain's top tennis star and his fiancee, Kim Sears, will be as 'nervous and as excited as any couple getting married'. The minister, who has been tight-lipped in recent weeks, said he was 'excited' to be part of the service, as final touches were added to the venue. The minister set to conduct the wedding ceremony said the whole town is excited as the event is 'the nearest we'll have  to a royal wedding'",

    "source": "A milk price war is set to break out following a landmark decision by the EU to scrap quotas restricting production . A milk price war is set to break out following a landmark decision by the EU to scrap quotas restricting production. The quota system was abolished today after 30 years - allowing dairy farmers to produce as much milk as they like without suffering a financial penalty. The move is expected to drive a spike in production, particularly in countries like Ireland, Germany and the Netherlands, who plan to boost exports of milk and other dairy products to the UK. As a result, a price war over the cost of milk is likely to break out, bringing down the price for consumers. However, British farmers are likely to find the price they are paid by supermarkets is driven down, which will be particularly difficult for smaller family businesses. Milk quotas were introduced in 1984 to address the oversupply during the late 1970s and early 1980s that had led to the infamous milk lakes and butter mountains. Farmers who produced above their quota were hit with punishing cash penalties. The new free-for-all will promote dairy factory farms, where super-size Holstein cows have been bred to produce more milk than any calf could drink in order to cut production costs. The industrialisation of dairy farming has seen the number of UK farms producing milk fall from 50,000 to 14,116 over the last 30 years. At the same time the average herd has risen from 64 cows to 134. The average milk production from Holstein dairy cows, which have been labelled ‘udders on legs’, has risen by 55per cent to 7,327 litres per animal per year – around 12,900 pints. In some cases this has been done through selective breeding programmes designed to create supersize cows, which are bulked up with high protein feed and kept inside for much of the year in what are known as ‘zero grazing’ barns. Dairy farmers have been under severe pressure in the past year as the result of a global glut in milk and a supermarket price war that drove down the price of a pint, making it cheaper than some bottled water. Some dairy processors have starting to raise farm gate prices recently, however farmers remain concerned the end of quotas could bring enormous price swings. Chairman of the dairy board at the National Farmers’ Union, Rob Harrison, has urged all EU countries to act responsibly and collectively in order to manage future volatility. Mr Harrison said: ‘Farmers and dairy processors here do have some concerns about how other EU countries will react to the ending of quotas. ‘Some are rapidly increasing their output without an end market for these goods. With milk prices yet to show any strong signs of recovery, this could push farmgate milk prices down further in the EU, and stall any recovery in the dairy markets. ‘It’s vital that expansion in any Member State is planned in accordance with available market opportunities.’ Dairy farmers have been under severe pressure in the past year as the result of a global glut in milk and a supermarket price war that drove down the price of a pint, making it cheaper than some bottled water . Mr Harrison said the new freedom could allow British dairy farmers, who are particularly efficient, to win new sales in Europe and around the world, particularly the Far East. He said: ‘We also need UK dairy processors to recognise and promote potential markets both at home and abroad and look to develop new products such as sports drinks.’ The idea of milk being promoted as a sports drink has been given credence by Coca-Cola, which has recently launched its own brand of milk in the United States. The new Fairlife milk costs more than twice as much as regular milk, but the firm believes consumers will pay more on the basis it contains 50per cent more protein and half the sugar. Earlier this week, some European farmer groups mounted a protest over the changes outside the European Parliament in Brussels, which involved a funeral march the lighting of a warning fire. The European Milk Board, a federation of dairy farmers with member organisations from 13 countries, said it was likely that the market would not be able to cope with significantly expanded production in a reasonable way. Its president, Romuald Schaber, said the changes are a particular threat to small dairy farmers, who tend to have higher costs. ‘Chronic price collapses are inevitable, the next crisis is on its way,’ he said. ‘Prices will be rock-bottom, as Europe’s farmers will have even less market power to achieve a cost-covering milk price in the future.’ Maria Heubuch, an MEP for the Greens, warned about the loss of small farmers. ‘Europe could see more factory farms with 1,000, 2,000 or even 5,000 cows, merely providing raw materials for the industry,’ she said. The European Dairy Association, which represents milk processors, has backed the end of quotas. Its Secretary General, Alexander Anton, said: ‘It goes without saying that the end of the quota will lower the administrative burden on all levels. This will naturally further enhance the competitiveness of the whole sector.’ Irish dairy farmers have embarked on a massive expansion plan and will be looking to make big in-roads to the British market. A study by the Irish Farmers Association (IFA) estimated the ending of quotas would create 9,500 extra jobs in Ireland, and at least 1.3 billion euros (£950m) in extra exports. While productions restrictions have been scrapped, the EU will provide a safety net for dairy farmers. Brussels will have the power to buy-in butter and skimmed milk powder at a guaranteed figure if there is over-supply, which will shore up the price.",

The quota system was abolished today after 30 years - allowing dairy farmers to produce as much milk as they like without suffering a financial penalty. The move is expected to drive a spike in production, particularly in countries like Ireland, Germany and the Netherlands, who plan to boost exports of milk and other dairy products to the UK. As a result, a price war over the cost of milk is likely to break out, bringing down the price for consumers. However, British farmers are likely to find the price they are paid by supermarkets is driven down, which will be particularly difficult for smaller family businesses.",

With milk prices yet to show any strong signs of recovery, this could push farmgate milk prices down further in the EU, and stall any recovery in the dairy markets.' The European Milk Board, a federation of dairy farmers with member organisations from 13 countries, said it was likely that the market would not be able to cope with significantly expanded production in a reasonable way.

    "source": "An Oregon teacher is suing her rural school district over the lingering stress she feels following a surprise active shooter drill that administrators held in 2013. Linda McLean was in her classroom at Pine Eagle Charter School in the tiny town of Halfway in August of that year when a masked man in a hoodie burst in with a gun, lowered it to her head and pulled the trigger. The 56-year-old elementary school teacher had no clue it was a drill to test her 'preparedness' or that the gun was loaded with blanks. 'You're dead,' the shooter said. Shooter drill: Pine Eagle Charter school in Halfway, Oregon was the scene of a surprise 'active shooter' drill that's left teacher Linda McLean with post-traumatic fears years later . In fact, she believed for a several moments that she would soon die. Now, years after learning of the 'harebrained scheme,' Oregon Live reports that McLean is still traumatized by the event. 'McLean could not figure out what was going on,' reads the lawsuit. 'She felt very confused. Her heart was racing. She walked out of the classroom and saw a pistol lying on the ground . 'She wondered if she was really shot and was going to die.' Class was out of session that day and school officials had warned emergency services in the area not to show up should any teachers call 911. They also ran checks on all the teacher to make sure none of them had concealed weapons permits, should they decide to fight back. The two masked 'intruders' stormed a room where several teachers had gathered. 'It was shocking,' teacher Dollie Beck admitted at the time, but 'it heightened my awareness about what's around me.' But well afterwards, says the complaint, McLean's awareness was possibly too heightened. 'She could not shake the event but continued to relive it and try to make sense of it, . 'Ms. McLean could not sleep, and remained anxious and vigilant. When she drifted off to sleep, she experienced nightmares and sweating.' Doctors diagnosed McLean with post-traumatic stress disorder and urged her to return to the school as a form of desensitization. However, 'when she returned she was short of breath, anxious, emotionally distressed, and had to leave. She has not returned to the school building since.' Now McLean wants reparations  'for her involuntary separation from employment, her medical and psychological treatment, and the loss of retirement contributions and fringe benefits.' She is suing members of the school board, the masked safety officer who ambushed her, school administrators and the alarm company that services the school for punitive damages and attorney fees.",

    "source": "The case of a British woman allegedly murdered by her pastor husband in Ghana took an astonishing twist last week when a court was told that she died of a heroin overdose. Hotel staff found the body of pregnant Charmain Speirs face-down in a bath where it is believed she had been lying for four days. Her husband Eric Isaiah Adusah – a self-proclaimed prophet and evangelical preacher – has been charged with her murder. Pastor Eric Isaiah Adusah has been charged with the murder of his pregnant wife, Charmaine Spears . Ms Speirs and Mr Adusah, who were married last September, were said to have argued during their stay . Local news reports said an autopsy showed the mother of one died of 'opiate heroin overdose'. Mr Adusah's defence lawyer Mr Adomako Acheampong has claimed in court that 41-year-old Ms Speirs was a habitual heroin user – and that her whole family were addicted to the drug. But speaking exclusively to The Mail on Sunday, Ms Speirs's brother Paul said that his sister had never touched drugs and it was 'an outrageous lie' to say his family were all addicts. He added: 'The defence lawyer seems to be suggesting she had been a heroin addict for years but that's absolute rubbish.' The gardener, 30, admitted that he had battled heroin addiction – but said it had been Ms Speirs who ensured he sought help at a Christian-run rehabilitation centre near Glasgow. He insisted he had now been drug-free for ten years. He also said his sister, who had an eight-year-old son from a previous relationship, would not have taken any such substances of her own accord, adding: 'My sister was always against drugs.' The couple pictured on a Christmas card. Mr Adusah is the leader of Global Light Revival Ministries church based in Tottenham, north London and has been active as a preacher in Britain since 2010 . And he rejected the claim that his entire family, including parents Peter, 63, a self-employed plumber, and 61-year-old cleaner Linda, were addicted to drugs, saying: 'My parents can't stand the things.' He revealed that Charmain's family had been surprised at her 'whirlwind marriage' to Mr Adusah last September and had never trusted him. And he said that her friends had noticed changes in Ms Speirs after she met and then married 28-year-old Mr Adusah, who was based in Britain but is originally from Ghana. Ms Speirs grew up in Arbroath in the Angus region of Scotland before moving to Swansea, where she studied photojournalism and then worked as a radiography assistant for the NHS. Last year she married Mr Adusah, leader of the Global Light Revival Ministries church based in Tottenham, North London. He has been active as a preacher in Britain since 2010. The couple travelled to Ghana early last month so Mr Adusah could preach at a three-day religious rally. On March 16 after the rally the couple checked in to the upmarket Mac-Dic Royal Plaza Hotel in Koforidua for five days. But when Mr Adusah left at dawn on their second day, he reportedly told reception staff not to disturb his wife as she was 'fasting and praying', and left a Do Not Disturb notice on the door. Hotel managers became concerned when Ms Speirs would not respond when they knocked. On March 20, porters used a spare key to gain access and made the grim discovery. Now her family are desperately seeking answers as they try to piece together fragments of information. Mr Speirs said: 'We've been left in the cold, we don't know a thing. My mum and dad just want to get Charmain's body back home.' A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said: 'We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.' Mr Adusah has been charged with murder in Ghana and has had his application for bail rejected. He has not yet entered a plea. The case has been adjourned until later this month.",
