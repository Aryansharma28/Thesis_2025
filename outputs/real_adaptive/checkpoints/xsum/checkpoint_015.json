Stained glass windows and ceilings have been restored, while the public will be able to visit the dining room and butler's pantry for the first time. Councillor Kate Butler, from Stockport Council, called it the 'jewel in the crown' of the town's heritage. The manor dates back to the reign of William the Conqueror when he bestowed the lands upon one of his followers, Hamon de Masci, who became the first Baron of Dunham Massey. Since then the estate has been under the ownership of just three families: the Davenports, De Bromales and Nevills. In 1936, the timber-framed hall and its surrounding parkland was handed over to the local council. The transformation followed a £1.6m grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and £400,000 in council funding.",

Defence counsel Shelagh McCall QC told the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh that the Crown conceded there was insufficient evidence to prove lack of consent on the coercion charge. The Lord Justice Clerk, Lady Dorrian, who heard the appeal with Lady Paton and Lord Turnbull, said: 'We are satisfied the concession is well made.' Lord Turnbull said that information conveyed to the court seemed to show that even at an earlier preparatory marking stage in the case there were concerns over a lack of corroboration. Mr Weatherhogg, of Guthrie, near Forfar, Angus, had denied the charges during the trial, but admitted a separate charge of uploading the film to the internet. He was jailed for four-and-years by Lady Wolffe with an additional 18 months for the charge he admitted. The appeal hearing was told that Mr Weatherhogg had been in custody since March last year and had served the 18 month sentence, taking into account early release provisions.",

The father of two, 31, has denied the charge at the Old Bailey in London. Using an online alias, Ali allegedly tried to order 500mg of the deadly toxin, the jury was told, which would have been enough to kill 1,400 people. As 'Weirdos 0000', Ali contacted a man on the black market and placed an order for the ricin, the court heard. He went on to negotiate the deal in encrypted exchanges unaware the United States-based 'dealer' was actually an FBI agent who alerted the British authorities. On 10 February, he took delivery of a toy car with 'special batteries' at the home he shared with his wife and two young sons. But instead of ricin, the five concealed packets contained a harmless powder and Ali was arrested.",

    "source": "According to three separate analyses, a flood of automated comments to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was detected over the weekend.\nMore than 400,000 comments with remarkably similar wording have been detected in recent days.\nNet neutrality proponents argue that all internet traffic should be equal.\nThis means that no content provider should be able to, for example, charge more for faster access to certain data.\nOne expert described bot activity as a new form of protest.\n\"Someone has gone out of their way to make these seem like real submissions,\" wrote Chris Sinchok in a blog post about the apparently automated activity.\nHaving downloaded the comments and associated data, Mr Sinchok noticed that the names and email addresses associated with thousands of them also turned up in lists of personal data stolen from websites.\nHe told the BBC that this suggested someone might be using information collected from breached databases to make the submissions look more authentic.\n\"It really seems like this is getting pooled from some place in an automated fashion and it's coming in at unreasonable rates,\" he said.\nHe added that the uniformity of the data was also a possible giveaway.\nFor example, many comments are essentially identical save for the occasional, small difference - such as the exact same sentence appearing in multiple comments, but with different letters capitalised each time.\nAnd the rate at which comments were posted also seemed suspicious, starting and stopping in bursts, he added.\nOther watchers, including a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and another at Harvard University, have also tracked a boom in apparently automated activity directed at the site in recent days.\nEarlier this month, the FCC said it had been targeted by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that led to downtime for the comments system.\nThis followed a television appearance by comedian John Oliver in which he urged people to post comments against the proposals on the FCC's website.\n\"Net neutrality is such a hot-button issue and it's one of the few examples of online activism that's actually amounted to something,\" noted Prof Phil Howard at the Oxford Internet Institute.\nHe cited the 2014 online protests, after which President Obama stepped in to recommend that the FCC drop earlier proposals to curtail net neutrality.\n\"This is how people protest these days,\" said Prof Howard, referring to the apparently automated comments.\nHe also pointed out that a growing number of people had the necessary programming skills to do it.\nHowever, Mr Sinchok is concerned that the bot activity will create the impression that genuine opposition to the FCC's current proposals does not really exist.\n\"There are people that care about this issue a lot,\" he told the BBC.\n\"Activity like this is really muddying the waters - and I don't want it to give [the FCC] an excuse to say, 'Hey, there's mixed support for this.'\"\nThe FCC has not yet responded to a BBC request for comment.",

    "source": "Schools are asked to create a dedicated page on their school website and send the web address (or URL) to schoolreport@bbc.co.uk and we will link to it from the map of participating schools.\nYou can use the official School Report graphics, which can be found at the foot of this page.\nThen, on School Report News Day on 16 March 2017, schools can upload their reports to their websites.\nHere are some frequently asked questions and answers about setting up web pages.\nIf you're not technically minded, don't worry! The best thing to do is to speak early on to your school's IT department or the people who look after the school website.\nYou need to create a dedicated School Report web page on the school website so that people can find the students' work. It has to be accessible to the public, so don't use internal websites (or intranets) or pages that need a password.\nUntil your pupils' reports are ready, the page should contain a \"holding\" or \"come back later\" message. You can copy and paste this:\nStudents from this school will be making the news for real on 16 March 2017 as they take part in BBC News School Report. We aim to publish the news by 1600 GMT on News Day, so please save this page as a favourite and return to it later.\nHave a click through to examples from our School Report map if you want an idea of how other schools have gone about it.\nOnce the page is live, email the web address (URL) to the School Report team via schoolreport@bbc.co.uk so we can link to your webpage.\nAs soon as possible! It saves a lot of hassle in the busy run-up to News Day when you and the School Reporters would probably rather be focusing on getting great interviews than sorting out technical issues.\nAs soon as your page is ready, the School Report team can link to your website from the map of participating schools. - as long as both pieces of School Report paperwork have been returned!\nOnce live, some schools use the page to reflect what's happening in the build-up to the News Day, for example adding team photos and encouraging pupils to post news reporting ideas.\nNo. It is important to create a dedicated web page, so the BBC can link directly to the students' journalistic work. The fewer the clicks, the more likely you are to retain the audience.\nAlso, after the News Day, the homepage of a school website will inevitably change, but creating a dedicated page means there is a permanent record of their work.\nYes. If your school has participated in School Report in previous years, you can use the existing web page, but remember to label it clearly.\nRemember, you risk losing people's attention if they think your web page is out of date. A simple message at the top of the page can be helpful, such as the example mentioned above.\nIf you can't publish School Report content on your school website, all is not lost!\nYou could look at hosting stories on another website that you consider appropriate and that is in line with your school's policy. See if your local council or academy sponsor could help host your content.\nSome schools have used websites such as Makewaves, a website designed to host video and audio material for educational purposes.\nYou could create a web page using a number of different programmes, with many people using software such as Microsoft Expression or Adobe Dreamweaver.\nIf you do use a site other than your school site, check the terms and conditions to make sure it is suitable for 11 to 16-year-olds and that there are no advertisements on the site.\nThe golden rule is to use first names only. For child protection reasons, the BBC cannot link to a page which contains the surnames of anyone younger than 18. This also applies to blog entries and comments posted on the page.\nRefer to the School Report guidelines on staying safe and legal which highlight some of the issues anyone should consider when publishing content which features children. This page also offers guidance about media law issues such as copyright, libel and contempt of court as well as editorial issues such as taste and decency.\nBe aware that the BBC website is very popular. By virtue of a link from the BBC, students will have a large audience but people will also be able to access other pages on the school website.\nAt the bottom of this page, there are some School Report graphics you can use on your dedicated web page. However, they can only be used by schools who have completed their paperwork, and within the context of the project.\nIt is also a good idea to incorporate the design of your school website to create a uniform look.\nIt is best to avoid a design which relies on large pictures as it will make pages slow to download and could put off potential viewers. However, you might like to add photographs of students taking part in School Report or the school logo.\nOur agreement with the head teacher of every school taking part explicitly states that the school, not the BBC, is responsible for the school website. Teachers need to decide on the most suitable way of hosting content according to their school's social media, internet safety and child protection policies.\nFor this reason, we are happy to link to school websites which use YouTube (or similar video-sharing websites) to embed content, provided the school website complies with our guidelines in all other ways. We will not, however, link directly to YouTube.\nSome schools have used websites such as Makewaves, a website designed to host video and audio material for educational purposes.\nProviding the school website complies with our guidelines in all other ways, we are happy to link to school websites containing links to social media.\nGenerally though, we do not recommend including links to social media websites such as Facebook and Twitter from your school website, as they are designed to be used by children aged 13 or over. There is a risk of students experiencing cyberbullying via such sites.\nIf your school website contains an automated Twitter feed, you may want to look into deactivating it or at least monitoring it during the busy time around News Day.\nA dedicated page means the audience can find students' work easily and quickly. It also provides a  permanent archive of students' reports and makes it clear that the reports are new and not from previous years. The page can also help avoid any potential child protection issues.\nRight click the images, and select Save Picture As.",
