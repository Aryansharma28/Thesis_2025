Stained glass windows and ceilings have been restored, while the public will be able to visit the dining room and butler's pantry for the first time. Councillor Kate Butler, from Stockport Council, called it the 'jewel in the crown' of the town's heritage. The manor dates back to the reign of William the Conqueror when he bestowed the lands upon one of his followers, Hamon de Masci, who became the first Baron of Dunham Massey. Since then the estate has been under the ownership of just three families: the Davenports, De Bromales and Nevills. In 1936, the timber-framed hall and its surrounding parkland was handed over to the local council. The transformation followed a £1.6m grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and £400,000 in council funding.",

Defence counsel Shelagh McCall QC told the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh that the Crown conceded there was insufficient evidence to prove lack of consent on the coercion charge. The Lord Justice Clerk, Lady Dorrian, who heard the appeal with Lady Paton and Lord Turnbull, said: 'We are satisfied the concession is well made.' Lord Turnbull said that information conveyed to the court seemed to show that even at an earlier preparatory marking stage in the case there were concerns over a lack of corroboration. Mr Weatherhogg, of Guthrie, near Forfar, Angus, had denied the charges during the trial, but admitted a separate charge of uploading the film to the internet. He was jailed for four-and-years by Lady Wolffe with an additional 18 months for the charge he admitted. The appeal hearing was told that Mr Weatherhogg had been in custody since March last year and had served the 18 month sentence, taking into account early release provisions.",

The father of two, 31, has denied the charge at the Old Bailey in London. Using an online alias, Ali allegedly tried to order 500mg of the deadly toxin, the jury was told, which would have been enough to kill 1,400 people. As 'Weirdos 0000', Ali contacted a man on the black market and placed an order for the ricin, the court heard. He went on to negotiate the deal in encrypted exchanges unaware the United States-based 'dealer' was actually an FBI agent who alerted the British authorities. On 10 February, he took delivery of a toy car with 'special batteries' at the home he shared with his wife and two young sons. But instead of ricin, the five concealed packets contained a harmless powder and Ali was arrested.",

    "source": "According to three separate analyses, a flood of automated comments to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was detected over the weekend.\nMore than 400,000 comments with remarkably similar wording have been detected in recent days.\nNet neutrality proponents argue that all internet traffic should be equal.\nThis means that no content provider should be able to, for example, charge more for faster access to certain data.\nOne expert described bot activity as a new form of protest.\n\"Someone has gone out of their way to make these seem like real submissions,\" wrote Chris Sinchok in a blog post about the apparently automated activity.\nHaving downloaded the comments and associated data, Mr Sinchok noticed that the names and email addresses associated with thousands of them also turned up in lists of personal data stolen from websites.\nHe told the BBC that this suggested someone might be using information collected from breached databases to make the submissions look more authentic.\n\"It really seems like this is getting pooled from some place in an automated fashion and it's coming in at unreasonable rates,\" he said.\nHe added that the uniformity of the data was also a possible giveaway.\nFor example, many comments are essentially identical save for the occasional, small difference - such as the exact same sentence appearing in multiple comments, but with different letters capitalised each time.\nAnd the rate at which comments were posted also seemed suspicious, starting and stopping in bursts, he added.\nOther watchers, including a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and another at Harvard University, have also tracked a boom in apparently automated activity directed at the site in recent days.\nEarlier this month, the FCC said it had been targeted by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that led to downtime for the comments system.\nThis followed a television appearance by comedian John Oliver in which he urged people to post comments against the proposals on the FCC's website.\n\"Net neutrality is such a hot-button issue and it's one of the few examples of online activism that's actually amounted to something,\" noted Prof Phil Howard at the Oxford Internet Institute.\nHe cited the 2014 online protests, after which President Obama stepped in to recommend that the FCC drop earlier proposals to curtail net neutrality.\n\"This is how people protest these days,\" said Prof Howard, referring to the apparently automated comments.\nHe also pointed out that a growing number of people had the necessary programming skills to do it.\nHowever, Mr Sinchok is concerned that the bot activity will create the impression that genuine opposition to the FCC's current proposals does not really exist.\n\"There are people that care about this issue a lot,\" he told the BBC.\n\"Activity like this is really muddying the waters - and I don't want it to give [the FCC] an excuse to say, 'Hey, there's mixed support for this.'\"\nThe FCC has not yet responded to a BBC request for comment.",

    "source": "Schools are asked to create a dedicated page on their school website and send the web address (or URL) to schoolreport@bbc.co.uk and we will link to it from the map of participating schools.\nYou can use the official School Report graphics, which can be found at the foot of this page.\nThen, on School Report News Day on 16 March 2017, schools can upload their reports to their websites.\nHere are some frequently asked questions and answers about setting up web pages.\nIf you're not technically minded, don't worry! The best thing to do is to speak early on to your school's IT department or the people who look after the school website.\nYou need to create a dedicated School Report web page on the school website so that people can find the students' work. It has to be accessible to the public, so don't use internal websites (or intranets) or pages that need a password.\nUntil your pupils' reports are ready, the page should contain a \"holding\" or \"come back later\" message. You can copy and paste this:\nStudents from this school will be making the news for real on 16 March 2017 as they take part in BBC News School Report. We aim to publish the news by 1600 GMT on News Day, so please save this page as a favourite and return to it later.\nHave a click through to examples from our School Report map if you want an idea of how other schools have gone about it.\nOnce the page is live, email the web address (URL) to the School Report team via schoolreport@bbc.co.uk so we can link to your webpage.\nAs soon as possible! It saves a lot of hassle in the busy run-up to News Day when you and the School Reporters would probably rather be focusing on getting great interviews than sorting out technical issues.\nAs soon as your page is ready, the School Report team can link to your website from the map of participating schools. - as long as both pieces of School Report paperwork have been returned!\nOnce live, some schools use the page to reflect what's happening in the build-up to the News Day, for example adding team photos and encouraging pupils to post news reporting ideas.\nNo. It is important to create a dedicated web page, so the BBC can link directly to the students' journalistic work. The fewer the clicks, the more likely you are to retain the audience.\nAlso, after the News Day, the homepage of a school website will inevitably change, but creating a dedicated page means there is a permanent record of their work.\nYes. If your school has participated in School Report in previous years, you can use the existing web page, but remember to label it clearly.\nRemember, you risk losing people's attention if they think your web page is out of date. A simple message at the top of the page can be helpful, such as the example mentioned above.\nIf you can't publish School Report content on your school website, all is not lost!\nYou could look at hosting stories on another website that you consider appropriate and that is in line with your school's policy. See if your local council or academy sponsor could help host your content.\nSome schools have used websites such as Makewaves, a website designed to host video and audio material for educational purposes.\nYou could create a web page using a number of different programmes, with many people using software such as Microsoft Expression or Adobe Dreamweaver.\nIf you do use a site other than your school site, check the terms and conditions to make sure it is suitable for 11 to 16-year-olds and that there are no advertisements on the site.\nThe golden rule is to use first names only. For child protection reasons, the BBC cannot link to a page which contains the surnames of anyone younger than 18. This also applies to blog entries and comments posted on the page.\nRefer to the School Report guidelines on staying safe and legal which highlight some of the issues anyone should consider when publishing content which features children. This page also offers guidance about media law issues such as copyright, libel and contempt of court as well as editorial issues such as taste and decency.\nBe aware that the BBC website is very popular. By virtue of a link from the BBC, students will have a large audience but people will also be able to access other pages on the school website.\nAt the bottom of this page, there are some School Report graphics you can use on your dedicated web page. However, they can only be used by schools who have completed their paperwork, and within the context of the project.\nIt is also a good idea to incorporate the design of your school website to create a uniform look.\nIt is best to avoid a design which relies on large pictures as it will make pages slow to download and could put off potential viewers. However, you might like to add photographs of students taking part in School Report or the school logo.\nOur agreement with the head teacher of every school taking part explicitly states that the school, not the BBC, is responsible for the school website. Teachers need to decide on the most suitable way of hosting content according to their school's social media, internet safety and child protection policies.\nFor this reason, we are happy to link to school websites which use YouTube (or similar video-sharing websites) to embed content, provided the school website complies with our guidelines in all other ways. We will not, however, link directly to YouTube.\nSome schools have used websites such as Makewaves, a website designed to host video and audio material for educational purposes.\nProviding the school website complies with our guidelines in all other ways, we are happy to link to school websites containing links to social media.\nGenerally though, we do not recommend including links to social media websites such as Facebook and Twitter from your school website, as they are designed to be used by children aged 13 or over. There is a risk of students experiencing cyberbullying via such sites.\nIf your school website contains an automated Twitter feed, you may want to look into deactivating it or at least monitoring it during the busy time around News Day.\nA dedicated page means the audience can find students' work easily and quickly. It also provides a  permanent archive of students' reports and makes it clear that the reports are new and not from previous years. The page can also help avoid any potential child protection issues.\nRight click the images, and select Save Picture As.",

It will now hold a series of meetings across Wales as it tries to rally members for an election that it'll be able to fight unshackled of being in coalition government which was clearly a burden to many of them.",

    "source": "In a speech he said, given the effects of the referendum vote, the government had to be \"realistic about achieving a surplus by the end of the decade\".\nThe target had been the chancellor's most prized goal and had been driving austerity measures in previous budgets.\nBut he said the economy is showing \"clear signs\" of shock following the vote to leave the European Union.\nGiving a speech in Manchester, Mr Osborne said: \"The referendum is expected to produce a significant negative economic shock to our economy. How we respond will determine the impact on jobs and growth.\n\"We must provide fiscal credibility, continuing to be tough on the deficit while being realistic about achieving a surplus by the end of the decade.\"\nLabour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell welcomed the move, saying: \"Sadly the vote last Thursday for Brexit has only brought forward what was inevitable.\n\"The Chancellor had already dropped his other fiscal rules on welfare and debt at the Budget in March, and according to many economists he was expected to be forced to drop this one too.\"\nBBC business editor Kamal Ahmed says that the target was heading for the \"Treasury shredding machine\" following a speech from Home Secretary Theresa May yesterday.\nIn a speech launching her bid to become prime minister she said \"we should no longer seek to reach a budget surplus by the end of the parliament\".\nKamal says that Mr Osborne has now followed suit.\nNevertheless, the Treasury insists that it still wants to balance the books and \"fix the finances\".\nMr Osborne first committed himself to returning the national finances to surplus by 2020 at the Conservative Party conference in 2013 and it became policy in the July budget of 2015.\nBut there have been questions ever since over whether that target could be met.\nEven before the referendum vote he only had \"a slightly better than 50/50 chance\" of making the target said Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.\nBut the uncertainty caused by the Leave vote could hold back the economy and make creating a surplus even more difficult.\n\"Having voted for Brexit last week, the economy is clearly going to go into a downswing, that might be a full-blown recession, that might just be very very low growth,\" said Paul Johnson the director of the IFS.\nIt is sometimes easy in these incredible political times to forget that for most people \"it's the economy, stupid\" still holds true.\nFor the UK economy, one of the most important passages of Theresa May's speech yesterday was when she signalled that George Osborne's \"fiscal rule\" (to produce a budget surplus by 2020) was for the Treasury shredding machine.\n\"While it is absolutely vital that the government continues with its intention to reduce public spending and cut the budget deficit, we should no longer seek to reach a budget surplus by the end of the parliament,\" Mrs May said.\nNow the chancellor has said he agrees, arguing that the government must be \"realistic\" about its fiscal targets and that austerity policies could be eased.\nMy Treasury sources point out that the \"rule\" can be varied in \"non-normal\" times.\nAnd these are pretty \"non-normal\" times.\nThe abandonment of the fiscal target suggests the government could borrow more, presumably for investment in infrastructure and to mitigate the need for tax rises and spending cuts, if the economy does take a turn for the worse as some predict.\nMore from Kamal: Brexit and the easing of austerity\nThe Tories have been in turmoil since David Cameron announced his intention to resign following the UK's vote in favour on leaving the European Union.\nIn a shock development on Thursday, Boris Johnson, widely seen as the frontrunner to become prime minister, announced that he would not be running.\nThe BBC has learned that Justice Secretary Michael Gove is now coming under growing pressure to abandon his bid to become Tory leader.\nSources have told the BBC government ministers are trying to persuade the justice secretary to give way so the party can \"unite\" around Home Secretary Theresa May.\nMr Gove opted to stand after switching his support from Boris Johnson.\nIn a speech, Mr Gove said his decision to stand to become Conservative leader is driven by \"conviction\" about what is right for the UK not personal ambition.\nThree other candidates have put their names forward for the Conservative leadership: Energy Minister Andrea Leadsom, MP Liam Fox and Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb.\nThe government borrowed Â£74.9bn in the 2015/2016 fiscal year and for the financial year so far - covering April and May - borrowing reached Â£17.9bn, Â£0.2bn higher than the same period a year ago.\nIt is thought that the government will now raise borrowing, so it can avoid further cuts in spending or raising taxes. It could also borrow to invest in big building projects.\n\"The problem of course is, you can't borrow forever,\"said Paul Johnson from the IFS.\n\"So we'll have a few more years of more borrowing, but my guess is this is not the end of austerity, actually this means austerity will just go on for longer because we'll probably have the spending cuts and tax rises right through the 2020s to pay for this.\"",

It will be done on Tuesday,\" he said.\nIn addition to the Port Talbot factory - the UK's largest steelworks - Tata's remaining assets include sites at Newport, where more than 1,300 people are employed, and Rotherham, which employs 1,200. Tata also has operations at Corby, Shotton and Teesside.\nMacquarie, the Australian bank, was advising Liberty on a potential bid, and is considered a potential financial backer of any takeover.\nLiberty House started life in the university room of Indian-born founder Sanjeev Gupta.\nWhile a student at Cambridge University in 1992, the budding entrepreneur started what has since become a global steel and commodities business with annual sales of more than £2bn.\nWith operations in 30 countries, and headquarters in London, Dubai, and Singapore, Mr Gupta's Liberty has also emerged as a possible saviour of Britain's steel industry.\nLiberty's focus is on recycling the mountains of scrap metal generated in the UK, rather than the historical method of producing steel in blast furnaces.\nLast month, it acquired Tata Steel's plants in Lanarkshire. In recent years, it has reached similar deals for steel plants in Newport and the Black Country.\nA management buyout team is also planning to submit a bid under the name Excalibur Steel UK Limited.\nIt has appointed investment banker Mark Rhydderch-Roberts as a non-executive director. He joins Stuart Wilkie, the head of Tata's United Kingdom strip steel business, and former Alcan senior executive and venture capitalist Roger Maggs, on the board.\nThe government has promised to support any buyer of the business by taking up to a 25% stake in a new business and making hundreds of millions of pounds of finance available.\nTata has not publicly set a deadline for any deal, but has made it clear it cannot sustain its £1m-a-day losses indefinitely and does not want to prolong the uncertainty for workers and customers.\nTata's Scunthorpe operation, which employs more than 3,000 people, has been sold to investment firm Greybull Capital for a nominal £1.",

And if the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn wins he would also claim endorsement for placing his own political priorities at the centre of the talks to come.\nBut in European terms, that's something of a secondary issue.\nThe EU Commission's lead negotiator, Michel Barnier, is going to have to deal with whoever is in residence in 10 Downing Street and the strength of the occupant's mandate won't be his concern.\nHis team have already said that while the announcement doesn't change anything, there's a hope that it will produce a strong leader with strong backing from the people of the UK.\nAnd we can be sure this British election will be watched with even closer attention than usual - not just in Brussels but in the other European capitals where Brexit is going to be a huge issue in the years to come.\nFirst, both Theresa May and all her rivals will have to set out their visions for Brexit in much more detail than we've heard so far.\nBritish voters will demand nothing less.\nBut in the process, the Barnier team and the governments of France, Germany and the rest will get a feeling for where the British red lines in negotiations really lie.\nAny British candidate worth his or her salt will try to leave room for manoeuvre in the talks to come after the election, but it will surely be impossible to campaign without giving away at least some detail.\nAnd of course there are romantics across Europe who hope that the voice of the Remainers will be heard loud and clear in the British debate to come.\nThe hope that Brexit might be quickly reversed has pretty much faded from the European debate now, but plenty of politicians across the continent will be hoping to hear candidates putting forward the argument for a soft Brexit with the closest possible links to the EU and its single market.\nThat may be wishful thinking, but there'll be strong support for such voices from many quarters in Europe.\nEurope was taken by surprise by Theresa May's announcement, but not taken aback. The EU negotiators have been working hard behind the scenes to prepare their position and their message is that they're ready to negotiate with Britain, no matter who occupies 10 Downing Street.\nThis was already a busy year for European democracy - the Netherlands has already voted, while France votes for a president at the weekend and will hold National Assembly elections in June.\nGermany goes to the polls in September.\nBut there's an awareness that the UK election will be different precisely because it will play a huge part in shaping the British negotiating position on Brexit.\nAnd, of course, there's also the fascination of the pure political theatre of it all.",

By comparison, the eurozone recorded growth of just 0.7% over the same period.\nAlong with Greece, Spain and Portugal, Ireland was among the eurozone's worst hit economies, with the bursting of its property bubble and soaring unemployment.\nThe 1.5% quarterly rise beat the 0.5% expected by economists polled in a survey by the Reuters news agency.\nMr Noonan said the faster growth would mean Ireland's budget deficit falling to about 3.5% of GDP this year against a target of 4.8%. That meant 2bn euros of tax rises and spending cuts planned for next year would no longer be needed to reach the EU limit of 3% by the end of 2015, he said.\nThe economic improvement comes after years of austerity, a bailout from international lenders, and relentless austerity measures.\n\"At face value, the numbers suggest that the boom is back,\" said Austin Hughes, chief economist at KBC Bank Ireland.\n\"It shows a clearly improving economy. It's very encouraging to see the improvement in consumption, in construction. So a domestic recovery is taking hold, if a lot less intense that the headline number would suggest,\" he said.",

    "source": "They talk of a boy who dressed smartly and worked hard, but who barely said a word during his time at school.\nPolice officers have said he may have had a personality or developmental disorder, while one relative told ABC News he was \"obviously not well\".\nLanza appears to have kept a low profile throughout his life. US media report that unusually, his high school yearbook of 2010 contained no photograph of him.\n\"Camera shy\" was the comment by his entry.\nUnlike the majority of his peers, Lanza apparently had no Facebook page. His online footprint was minimal. He appears not to have been known to the police.\nAdam Lanza lived with his mother in a well-to-do neighbourhood of Newtown, Connecticut. The house is about five miles (8km) from Sandy Hook School, which he attended as a child.\nHe went on to Newtown High School, but made few friends. His mother pulled him out of the school and taught him at home because she was unhappy with the school district's plan for his education.\nHis aunt, Marsha Lanza, said that Adam was \"definitely the challenge to the family in that house\".\n\"Every family has one. I have one. They have one. â€¦ But he was a very bright boy, he was smart,\" she said.\nIntelligent but shy and nervous were the most common memories of those who learnt beside him.\nRichard Novia, who was head of security at Newtown High School, said it was clear Lanza had \"some disabilities\".\nHe was protective of his personal space and sometimes appeared to completely withdraw into himself or to \"take flight\", Mr Novia told AP, meaning his mother had to be called in to resolve the problem.\n\"You had yourself a very scared young boy, who was very nervous around people he could trust or he refused to speak with.\"\nMr Novia helped to run a technology club, which Lanza attended, and said he had to keep a close eye on him while the club was using soldering equipment or electrical equipment.\n\"If that boy would've burned himself, he would not have known it or felt it physically,\" he said.\nAn inability to respond to sensation, and a difficult in relating to other people, could be an indication of Asperger's Syndrome (a form of autism), say experts.\nThey stress there is no direct link between the condition and aggression. People with the condition can sometimes struggle to express themselves in socially expected ways, however.\nOlivia DeVivo was a student with Lanza in the 10th grade, at about the age of 15. She told the Associated Press he was \"very shy and didn't make an effort to interact with anybody\".\n\"Now looking back, it's kind of like 'OK, he had all these signs,' but you can't say every shy person would do something like this,\" she said.\nA former school bus driver in the town, Marsha Moskowitz, said she remembered the Lanza boys.\n\"You know the trouble kids, and you figure, 'Pfft, that one's going to be trouble.' But I never would have thought that about them,\" she told the Hartford Courant newspaper.\nMarsha Lanza told the Associated Press that Adam had been raised by kind, nurturing parents, who would not have hesitated to seek counselling for their son if he needed it.\nThe parents divorced in 2009, having separated at least three years earlier. His father, Peter Lanza, moved to Stamford, Connecticut, and recently remarried.\nHis mother, Nancy, remained in the family home, where it is thought she was killed by her son. She had previously worked in finance, but her divorce settlement left her well off and she stayed at home.\nFriends said she was popular and sociable. An acquaintance, Jim Leff, wrote on his blog that she was \"a friend-of-friends who I periodically would briefly bump into, and who always seemed kind-hearted... and, yes, a bit high-strung. But with ample reason, as it turns out.\"\nContrary to initial reports, Nancy Lanza never worked as a teacher at Sandy Hook Elementary School.\nShe was a gun enthusiast who is reported to have taken her sons with her to the shooting range. Adam Lanza used her legally purchased Bushmaster assault rifle to carry out his attack. He was also carrying his mother's two handguns, a Glock pistol and a Sig Sauer. Police found a shotgun in his car.\nAdam Lanza's elder brother, 24-year-old Ryan, who was initially named in the media as the suspected gunman, has been helping police with their investigation. US media is reporting that he told them he had had no contact with his brother since 2010.\nIn a statement issued to the media, Lanza's father said: \"No words can truly express how heartbroken we are.\n\"We, too, are asking why. Like so many of you, we are saddened and struggling to make sense of what has transpired.\"",

    "generated": "Adam Lanza, an intelligent but severely withdrawn young man who lived with his gun-enthusiast mother in Newtown, exhibited concerning behavioral patterns including extreme social anxiety and possible developmental issues, requiring special supervision during his school years.",

Hartlepool Borough's council asked the area's clinical commissioning group (CCG) to explore with the bidder how it could reach the required standard. But, the CCG said it could not lawfully treat one bidder differently. Care Fertility, which operates 15 clinics across Britain and supports fertility services in Hartlepool, said in January it was 'disappointed not to be awarded the contract'. The council's audit and governance committee asked the CCG to discuss with the firm how it could reduce risks highlighted in its rejected tender. The CCG said this was not 'reasonably practicable'. 'It is simply not the role of the CCG to guide bidders to make successful tenders,' it said. It would be an 'unusual and unwelcome' precedent for the CCG to advise bidders and would lead to accusations of unfairness if it did not do the same for all other bidders in the future, it said.",

The Conference bent over backwards to help them.\n\"I described the news of the board's offer of an extension on Friday evening as not so much 'last chance saloon', but rather 'last orders in last chance saloon' and United have seemingly chosen not to offer the league the assurances they were seeking.\n\"It is a desperately sad day for all Hereford supporters, but the Bulls have nobody to blame but themselves.\n\"You have to feel very sorry for those players who gave their all at Aldershot on the last day of the season to keep Hereford in the Conference Premier. Sadly, those efforts now count for nothing.\"\nThe Conference had originally offered a payment deadline of Thursday, 5 June.\nThe club's debt to their football creditors, including former boss Martin Foyle, members of the current squad, other club staff and clubs from whom the Bulls loaned players during the 2013-14 season, added up to £148,000.\nThat deadline was extended three times, to Friday, 6 June, then again to Saturday, 7 June and for a third time until Thursday, 12 June.\nBut it became clear on Tuesday that the Bulls, taken over last week by London businessman Tommy Agombar, would not make that deadline - and the Conference has now acted.\nThe last team to be expelled from the Conference was Chester City in February 2010.\nThey reformed as Chester FC two months later - and it is now they who have taken the Bulls' place, following a dramatic final day of the season when, almost simultaneously, a late Hereford winning goal at Aldershot and a Salisbury equaliser at Chester kept the Bulls up.\nBy way of an added twist, Chester announced on Tuesday that Kingsley James, who was in Hereford's team that day, has moved to Bumpers Lane.\n26 April - Hereford stay up on final day of Conference Premier season\n29 April - Hereford United Supporters' Trust make offer to buy the club for £1 and clear their £220,000 debts\n22 May -  Former Bulls boss Martin Foyle serves winding-up petition over unpaid wages, after players reveal they have not been fully paid too\n2 June - Case adjourned for 28 days at Royal Court of Justice\n3 June - Tommy Agombar takes over as new Hereford owner\n5 June - Hereford fail to meet 17:00 BST deadline to pay football creditors, and are threatened with expulsion, subject to Conference board vote\n6 June - Hereford meet with Conference board and are given new deadline of 7 June. The deadline is moved to 9 June, then 12 June\n10 June - Hereford expelled from Football Conference\nAnd former Hereford boss Foyle, now manager at Southport, chose the same day to sign another player from that same Bulls team, keeper Dan Lloyd-Weston, who opted to leave as he was still owed part of his salary.\nWhen last season ended, despite months of fundraising efforts by fans, as well as generous donations from fans of other clubs, the Bulls faced debts of approximately £225,000.\nThey still owe over £70,000 to clear the latest PAYE tax demand from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).\nAn offer was made by one of the club's main fan bodies, the Hereford United Supporters' Trust (HUST), on the back of pledges made by their backers, to buy the club for £1 and take over the running at Edgar Street.\nBut, although chairman David Keyte held talks with them, they were not the preferred option.\nKeyte was reported to have been in talks with three different rival bidders before Agombar's takeover.\nThe downward spiral of Hereford's financial situation since being relegated from the Football League in May 2012 has been exacerbated by falling gates.\nThe average attendance for the 2013-14 season at Edgar Street was 1,758, little over half the average gate they attracted of 3,270 in League Two just five years ago.",

    "source": "His grandmother offered him a plate of grapes, but she doesn't remember whether Faizan had it. The son of a farmer then put on his pheran, the woollen cape-like garment Kashmiris wear, and quietly left for his Sunday lessons.\nA few hours later, Faizan lay dead near a sun-baked school playground, ringed by bare walnut and willow trees. Paramilitary soldiers, eyewitnesses alleged, had shot him in the back of his head.\nCarrying a packet of biscuits, he was returning home on a bright, nippy morning when he encountered a throng of local people protesting against Indian rule near the school, where polling was taking place for a parliamentary by-election.\nEyewitnesses say four shots rang out of the single-storey, squat school building which, according to some reports, was being pelted with stones thrown by protesters from a hill above and from the road in front.\nFaizan possibly halted to find out what the commotion was all about, and was hit by a bullet. Two neighbours ran up to his home to deliver the news. His mother had sprinted down to the playground, hugged her bleeding son and let others take him to hospital.\n\"I knew he was gone,\" Zarifa told me.\nA heart-wrenching video recorded by a villager on his mobile phone minutes after the killing shows a wailing man cradling the dead boy, blood streaming down his broken face, in a packed vehicle taking him to the nearest hospital. There, the doctors declared him dead.\nFaizan's final journey is recorded on another mobile phone video: his slight frame, draped in white, bobbing slightly on a hospital cot, carried through a sea of weeping, agitated mourners extolling their latest \"martyr\". By late afternoon, his body was lowered into the grave near his village, Dalwan.\nFaizan was among the eight people killed on Sunday when paramilitary soldiers fired bullets and shotgun pellets at those protesting against Indian rule at polling centres near Srinagar, the summer capital. Election authorities say some 170 people, including 100 security personnel, were injured in about 200 incidents of stone pelting and violent protests on the day.\nThe voter turnout in Sunday's election was an abysmal 7.1% - the lowest in decades - and came as a huge setback for the region's mainstream parties.\nThe soldiers had been brought in from other states to secure polling stations and may have been unprepared to deal with \"protests and provocation\" in a complex conflict zone like Kashmir, a senior official told me.\nOne report said the police had registered complaints against the paramilitary forces for firing into the crowds.\nSeparatist groups had rejected the elections and urged voters to boycott Sunday's poll, which took place after a politician resigned over what he described as the \"anti-people\" agenda of the Indian government.\nDisillusioned voters - even in relatively peaceful places like Dalwan where people turned out to cast their votes enthusiastically in previous elections - generally stayed away.\nWhy Faizan was killed on a day when local voters rejected the ballot is not clear.\nBy all accounts, he was not pelting stones or hurling abuse at the soldiers. One report said police fired tear gas shells to keep the protesters away from the empty polling station, but the soldiers opened fire.\nWhatever it is, Faizan became another grisly statistic in Kashmir's unending tragedy.\nA picture taken by his friend on his mobile phone during their winter break shows the shy-looking boy - \"he would often top his class, and he was very knowledgeable about the world,\" the friend said - clad in a woollen cap and collared jacket, peering uneasily into the camera.\n\"He was quiet and studious, he was doing well in school. He played cricket, and counted [former Indian captain] MS Dhoni as his favourite cricketer. He wanted to become a doctor,\" a cousin told me, when I visited the family.\nGrief is the price one pays for love. Zarifa's lament for her dead son filled the still air inside a tent outside their home where local women had gathered to mourn.\n\"My son, my son, where will I find you now?\" she cried, again and again.\nThen she stepped out of the tent, entered her home and joined her husband in a dank, cold room. He sat there, stoic and numb, surrounded by mourners, and gazed vacantly at the pastel pink walls. The room had a red carpet and red window curtains.\n\"The blood of a martyr never goes waste,\" said Fayaz Ahmad Dar. \"One day, the blood of innocents will help us gain our freedom [from Indian rule].\"\nA brief silence followed. Zarifa broke it, bemoaning the loss of her boy.\n\"I am looking at your books, I am looking at your school bags. How will I touch your books again, my son? Everybody would talk about your intelligence, how you would answer every question with so much wit.\"\nOutside the secondary school - Enter to learn, Leave to serve, its motto, is engraved on the walls - a group of young men gathered later in the day. Their eyes seethed in anger. They spoke about frustration, alienation, desperation, humiliation and hopelessness.\nThey said they had lost their fear of life. They insisted that they helped rebels because \"they are our brothers and don't kill civilians\" and are \"fighting for freedom\".\nMore than half of them raised their hands when asked whether they had pelted stones at Indian forces.\n\"We are not safe in our own homes, we are not safe on streets. They are killing little boys now. Life is uncertain,\" said Feroze Ali, a school clerk.\nSince February alone, some two dozen civilians have been killed during gunfights between armed rebels and security forces. The security forces have accused civilians of helping rebels escape.\nThe army says it has tried to reach out and engage with civilians through its 29 schools, youth clubs and cricket tournaments.\nRecently some 19,000 Kashmiri young men applied for a few hundred vacancies in the army.\n\"Provocation and panic can lead to accidents. Security forces often fire when they face life threatening situations. But protecting civilians remains our first priority in this situation. When a civilian dies, it hurts us,\" an army officer told me.\nThe region has seen heightened tension and increased unrest since July when influential militant Burhan Wani was killed by Indian forces. More than 100 civilians lost their lives in clashes with protesters during a four-month-long lockdown, including a 55-day-curfew, in the restive Muslim-majority valley.\nKashmir, clearly, appears to be teetering on the brink of an open public revolt against Indian rule.\nMany say the federal government's near-complete lack of engagement and dialogue with local stakeholders and Pakistan, a complete mistrust of the local government and a lack of development and jobs have left most people jittery and alienated.\nMilitancy continues to be at low ebb - there are an estimated 250 militants in the state now of which 150 are local - compared to several thousand during the peak of insurgency in the 1990s.\nBut young Kashmiris - more than 60% of the men in the valley are under 30, and more than 40% of men in Kashmir are jobless - are restless and angry. The local political parties are in danger of \"becoming irrelevant\", as a leader of an opposition party told me.\n\"This is the worst situation that I have seen. Earlier, it was a movement led by the militants. Now it is being led by the people,\" says Feroze Ali, 35, a schoolteacher.\n\"India needs to be worried, very worried about this.\"",

He was detained as he left the station the following day.\nExamination of Trotter's phone and his home computer established that he had been using his mobile on various days between 11 June and 29 September, with 22 videos showing the camera had been directed under women's skirts.\nDefence solicitor Neil Hay told the court Trotter was \"most ashamed of his actions\", and \"well aware his behaviour is unacceptable\".\nHe said his client had \"lost his career, brought his family to the brink of financial ruin and brought shame and humiliation to himself and those very close to him\".\nSentencing him to 18 months in prison, Sheriff Peter Braid told Trotter: \"You have pled guilty to taking images of women in a clandestine manner, prompted by voyeuristic impulses for your own sexual gratification.\n\"This involved significant planning committed over a period of more than three months in public places where women should be able to walk without fear.\n\"The repugnance society must feel towards these offences is such that, in my view, there is no alternative to a custodial sentence, in retribution and to deter others.\"",

Immediately after the UK leaders debates, George Osborne was talking up the performance of Nicola Sturgeon.\n\"I am not sure what kind of bizarre tactical game he was playing but it can only have helped the SNP increase their support further.\n\"And now the Conservatives in Scotland are getting in the way of our battles to stop the SNP in the 11 Westminster seats we hold in Scotland.\"\nWhat are the top issues for each political party at the 2015 general election?\nPolicy guide: Where the parties stand\nMs Sturgeon attacked both the Tories and Labour as she continued election campaigning.\nShe said: \"People in Scotland have always known to expect harsh, ideological cuts from the Tories - and today's cuts manifesto is likely to be more of the same. But that Labour have been so quick to meekly fall into line with George Osborne's plans just goes to show how far they have moved away from their roots.\n\"And with Ed Balls lifting the lid on Labour's cuts plans yesterday and finally putting an end to Jim Murphy's anti-cuts pretence, Labour's commitment to austerity is clear for all to see.\"\nThe SNP leader and first minister of Scotland had earlier taken questions from listeners on BBC Radio's Five Live morning phone in.\nIn response to a question from presenter Nicky Campbell, Ms Sturgeon reiterated that she was not planning another independence referendum. She said that if you voted SNP on 7 May, you were not voting for another referendum.\nIn Cumbernauld, Mr Murphy said SNP plans for Scottish taxes supporting Scotland's finances would mean millions lost for working families in tax credits.\nMr Murphy said: \"The SNP's reckless plans will cost working families the most, with a £7.6bn black hole in Scotland's finances and the end of the UK welfare state as we know it.\n\"Scotland doesn't have to choose between Tory austerity or SNP austerity max. Scottish Labour is the only party on the ballot paper offering a real alternative to austerity.\n\"Only Labour is big enough and strong enough to kick the Tories out and give working families the support they need.\"\nMeanwhile, the Scottish Greens backed the manifesto commitments of the Green Party of England and Wales which they believe would make a positive difference to people's lives.\nAlison Johnstone, from the Scottish Greens said: \"Greens across these islands are clear: we must end Westminster's failed austerity experiment.\"\nVoters throughout the UK go to the polls on 7 May to choose their next MP.\nPolling suggests the contest will be tight and no one party will win an overall majority in the House of Commons.",

However, details were scant with no launch date or countries mentioned, and no comment about how it would affect the firm's existing Zune product.\nUS users were promised new content including NBA basketball games, Paramount Pictures movies and Nickelodeon children's programmes.\nMuch of the rest of the presentation was dedicated to trailers showcasing new titles in existing video game franchises such as Tomb Raider, Fable, Call of Duty and Resident Evil.\n\"We're probably getting a new Xbox console in 2013 so that will be what the next E3 is about, so they had to spend this year talking about the stuff that precedes it,\" said Mr Totilo.\n\"But people who get upset about sequels forget they tend to be some of the best games ever made as developers don't have to worry about working with new hardware, and can instead hone their craft and be creative.\"",

Jersey's St Peter's ladies side played in the 2004 FA Women's Cup, losing 3-1 to Aldershot Town in the first qualifying round.\nThe FA has given Guernsey until Monday, 24 June to decide if they want to enter on those terms, and told BBC South West Sport that they would not comment until that time.\n\"They haven't given a reason, they've just set out these conditions,\" Braybrook said.\n\"I can only imagine their concern is that opposing clubs would have to travel over midweek, and at a lower level some of the players will have to work and they may have concerns about that.\n\"We would love to be in the competition but it's purely finance.\n\"Playing in the Ryman League this year will increase our costs considerably, with more matches, more overnight stays and longer journeys.\n\"If we play a game on the mainland, drew and then pay for the replay, it could potentially cost us £10,000 to play one round.\"\nThe club has launched a campaign to try to raise money in Guernsey to help fund their cup matches.",

    "source": "Air accident investigators have been briefing families ahead of official publication of their final report.\nThe police helicopter crashed onto the busy Clutha bar on 29 November 2013.\nAn earlier interim report said the engines had shut down even though there was fuel in the reserve tank.\nSome relatives said the briefing had left many questions unanswered, and underlined the need for black box flight recorders to be fitted in all passenger-carrying aircraft.\nFollowing the meeting with the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) in Glasgow on Wednesday evening, Ian O'Prey whose son Mark died in the bar, said there was \"no resolution\" to the tragedy.\nMr O'Prey said there had been a few \"heated moments\" during the meeting but it \"all calmed down\".\nHe said: \"I don't think I'm any further forward. The AAIB - they think it was switches that were left on - or weren't left on.\n\"My main question to them was flight recorders -  if they had flight recorders, it would have taken us a fraction of the time it has taken us.\n\"Personally I feel calmer than I did before I went in. I can't keep shouting at the moon for the rest of my life although I feel I want to.\"\nInvestigators are due to hold another closed meeting with bereaved relatives on Thursday and have asked families not to discuss the detailed findings until the report's official publication on Friday.\nJohn McGarrigle, whose father John died, said he felt \"let down\" despite optimism ahead of AAIB meeting.\nMr McGarrigle said: \"All tonight has done for me is raise loads more questions. My head is scrambled, I'm that angry.\n\"Flight data recorders should be installed in every passenger-carrying aircraft - simple as. If we had that, we would know a lot more.\n\"We wouldn't know the full cause, but we would know half of the reasons at least and we would have learned from it.\"\nJim Morris, an aviation law expert with Irwin Mitchell Solicitors, also said the lack of a \"black box\" had hampered the investigation.\nHe said: \"Unfortunately, in my view, due to a lack of a requirement to fit a black box flight data recorder, we have almost more unanswered questions.\"\nMr Morris added: \"We still do not know why fuel did not reach the engines.\n\"The report goes into significant detail in its analysis but it is clear from what is said in the report that they can't answer all the questions.\"\nAnne-Marie Kennedy, who was working behind the bar and was trapped in the wreckage, said she was \"satisfied\" with how the briefing went.\nShe said: \"It's shown me that they should have black boxes for defo, it's shown me the need for other regulation, but other than that nothing.\n\"Until I speak to my legal team I can only speculate.\n\"I'm satisfied with the way the night went. I believe that the AAIB has done everything in their power.\n\"The guy explained the investigation, the complexity and the length of time. They did all they could.\"\nFind out more\nThe Police Scotland Eurocopter EC 135, operated by Bond Air Services, came down on to the roof of the Clutha Bar at about 22:25 on a busy Friday night.\nThe helicopter crew who were killed were pilot David Traill, PC Tony Collins and PC Kirsty Nelis.\nThe seven customers in the Clutha who died were John McGarrigle, Mark O'Prey, Gary Arthur, Colin Gibson, Robert Jenkins, Samuel McGhee and Joe Cusker.\nThe Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) issued an interim report last year which said that both engines on the helicopter \"flamed out\" due to a fuel supply problem.\nThe report, however, did not set out the cause.",

    "source": "When Google paid $3.2bn (Â£2.1bn) to buy Tony Fadell's start-up Nest in 2014, it got much more than just an internet-connected thermostat and smoke detector.\nIt got the man dubbed the \"the iPod's father\" - the engineer/designer who sold Steve Jobs on his vision of a portable music player, and then worked alongside Jony Ive to build it, update it and then repeat the process with the iPhone.\nNow, the two men are set to go head-to-head. First with wearable tech, and then later, perhaps, with competing car designs - more of which later.\nTellingly, Mr Fadell reveals he recently started testing Sir Jonathan's latest product, the Apple Watch, although he was not wearing it at the time of interview.\n\"I've had mine for about two weeks now,\" he says.\n\"I think they did a tremendous job on the hardware components of it.\n\"They are trying many different things with that platform - some are going to be great, and some are not.\"\nWhen Mr Fadell agreed to sell Nest to Google, the reason he gave was that joining forces would accelerate his \"thoughtful home\" master plan - he hates the term \"internet of things\", which he says does a \"disservice\" to his products.\nBut in January, it became clear that Google's chief executive, Larry Page, had wider uses for his hardware expertise, and the troubled Glass computer was added to his duties.\n\"It wasn't handed to me and said, 'Tony clean it up,'\" Mr Fadell clarifies, \"I offered.\"\n\"I remember what it was like when we did the iPod and the iPhone. I think this can be that important, but it's going to take time to get it right.\"\nThe $1,500 (Â£965) \"explorer edition\" of Glass was soon pulled from sale, and Mr Fadell made clear that future test versions would be kept in-house.\nThat was widely seen as a shift in strategy for Google - a company that took five years to take its Gmail service out of \"beta\" status, and that still invites users to \"play\" with preview versions of other products.\nMoreover, it caused anger among developers who had sunk time and money into making apps for a product that no longer existed.\nBut Mr Fadell defends the shift, saying a distinction needed to be drawn between hardware and software.\n\"If you are only doing services based on electrons, you can iterate quickly, test it, and modify it and get it right,\" he says.\n\"But when you are dealing with actual atoms - hardware - and you have to get manufacturing lines and it takes a year or more to develop that product, you better understand what it is and what it's trying to do and specifically what it's not going to do.\n\"Customers have to spend money to buy those atoms.\n\"They want something that delivers value or you end up with a real disappointment and you can spoil the market.\"\nFor now, that leaves Mr Fadell's reputation dependent on his Nest line-up.\nIt is limited to three products, including the recently launched Nest Cam.\nThe motion-detecting camera streams live footage and sound from the owner's home to an app and can save memorable moments in the cloud.\nIf you get over the creepiness factor of effectively spying on your family, it's fair to say the device shares the crisp, stylish look of the Nest's other products, and reviews have been positive.\nBut the camera is actually an upgrade to an earlier device made by Dropcam - a company Nest acquired.\nThat means Mr Fadell's division has not created a new product category of its own since joining Google.\nBearing in mind, Mr Page told him to \"keep doing what you're doing, and do it as fast as you possibly can\", it raises the question: what's taking so long?\n\"Talk to me about the number of home product companies who have come out with three different product categories in less than five years... are shipping and they are the number ones in their category,\" says Mr Fadell, slightly bristling.\n\"I would love to have more, faster.\n\"But it takes time - it really takes time to make these products to the level of design and near-perfection that we achieve.\"\nHe adds that Nest's biggest goal right now is to expand the range of third-party products its devices talk to - for example its Thermostats can switch LG fridges into energy-saving mode when no-one's in, and its Protect sensors can make Philip's Hue lights flash red if they detect smoke or carbon monoxide.\nBut such advances have less impact than a new product.\n\"Despite his substantial success to date and involvement in key products such as Apple iPod, Mr Fadell has arguably not yet reached the truly iconic status bestowed upon Jonathan Ive,\" Ben Wood, from the tech consultancy CCS Insight, says.\n\"Given the huge amount Google invested in the acquisition of Nest to secure his services there must be an expectation that he too can deliver his own portfolio of truly disruptive devices with mass appeal.\n\"Google still lacks a smash-hit consumer electronics device of its own - it would be sensible to assume it hopes Mr Fadell can deliver that missing element.\"\nThe two men worked together on first iPods and iPhones, but are credited with different achievements.\nWith the iPod, Mr Fadell first convinced Steve Jobs of the wisdom of developing a portable music player and then worked out how to incorporate a hard drive - a fragile component - into a device that could be thrown about, sat on and generally abused.\nJony Ive's breakthrough was his design of its thumb-wheel, which scrolled through songs more rapidly as it was spun more quickly.\nWith the iPhone, perhaps Mr Fadell's greatest feat was finding a way to shrink the tech necessary to offer a multi-touch user interface on a handheld device.\nJony Ive's skill was best summed up by one writer as making the final product look almost more like \"a piece of jewellery than a gadget\".\nIn post-Jobs Apple, Sir Jonathan's influence has grown further - extending to the look of the company's operating system software, the creation of its Watch and even the design of its new headquarters.\nBy contrast, Mr Fadell has thrived beyond - building and selling a multi-billion dollar company, reinventing mundane household devices as desirable gadgets, and becoming one of Google's key figures.\nThis leads to thoughts about whether Mr Fadell could become involved in other Google projects.\nA question about working on its growing roster of robots is rebuffed on the grounds that they are still a long way from leaving the lab.\nBut self-driving cars, he adds, are much closer to launch and a \"big curiosity\".\n\"I don't think you've seen anything of what the design of the car could look like when it first materialises,\" he says.\n\"How do you make those occupants feel like they are safe and make sure they are safe?\n\"How does the car exude safety [and be] fashionable as well?\n\"How does this 'utility' self-driving car also be a reflection of you, right, as well as itself and also be transparent about its safety?\n\"Those are very interesting questions that still need to be dealt with.\"\nHe adds that he has \"some thoughts\" about the answers and is sharing them with others involved in Google's self-driving car project.\n\"We are having discussion about them all the time,\" he says.\n\"I always have ideas - it's whether or not people want to hear them.\"\nSo, nothing official yet.\nBut it would not be a surprise if Google eventually announces Mr Fadell is adding automobile design to his list of duties.\nAnd if, as rumoured, Sir Jonathan and his team are also working on their own electric car concept, that could set up a fascinating clash between the two former colleagues in the future.",

Let's play budget bingo.\n\"Osborne's austerity is wrong for Scotland\": There will be a squeeze of more than 5% (the Scottish government prefers a slightly different calculation rounding it up to 6%) in current or revenue (non-capital) spending.\n\"Difficult decisions have to be made\": If the health service is protected from cuts, and schools too, departments with less than half the budget have to absorb all the cuts.\nThat is likely to feature local government, which has been told to brace itself for some deep cuts in grant funding over the next five years.\nJohn Swinney could sweeten the pill by allowing them to raise council tax - as George Osborne did south of the border, allowing a 2% council tax rise if it is to pay for social care.\nBut it will be tempting to stick to a ninth year of freezing council tax, even though that will cost him a cumulated Â£630m out of next year's budget, and even though it is more generous to those with the biggest bills.\n\"Taxes for a fairer Scotland\": That'll be the reason for not using the new Scottish Rate of Income Tax. Both Mr Swinney and the first minister have said they want to use income tax powers only when they are sufficiently flexible to tilt the burden towards those most able to pay it.\nThat will probably, eventually, mean a rise in higher rate tax, or changes to thresholds. That flexibility won't be added to this year's new powers until 2017.\n\"A healthy private rented housing market\": Mr Swinney could choose to follow Mr Osborne's example last month, by raising property transaction tax on buy-to-let homes. It would be a progressive move.\nBut the Scottish finance secretary doesn't need to burst a house price bubble in and around his capital city. He may also want to give landlords something they like, to make up for the boost to tenants' rights they are soon to face.\n\"ESA10\": Technical jargon for public finance nerds, but it matters a lot. Mr Swinney has to give more detail than he did last month on the constraints placed on capital projects by a European accounting rule that makes significant capital projects a public liability rather than the private one that had been planned.\n\"Scottish Fiscal Commission\": This independent, new-ish body will publish its reckoning of Mr Swinney's fiscal projections at the same time his draft budget is delivered. Watch for a shortfall in revenue from Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (the successor to Stamp Duty).\n\"The A9\": The road is busy, it's being dualled, slowly, and it runs right through Mr Swinney's constituency.\n\"PFI on steroids\": Labour's Jackie Baillie will complain about the \"debt mountain\" being built up under the SNP. Quoting a report from The Guardian about Â£15bn of council debt and the liabilities resulting from the Public Finance Initiative and its successors, she probably won't explain that a lot of it was built up while she was a minister.\n\"Capitulation to the powerful roads lobby\": Greens will complain that insufficient money has been directed towards household energy efficiency, and too much is going on building a new Forth crossing and Aberdeen ring road.\n\"Eye off the ball\": Conservatives will blame any and all shortcomings in public sector performance and economic performance on the SNP government's campaign for independence. It's a way of rallying 'No' voters. Watch Ruth Davidson for pointers towards manifesto tax cut pledges.\n\"Budget for fairness, for growth and for Scotland\": Whatever is announced, and whatever the reality, Mr Swinney will present his draft budget as all these and more.\n\"House!\" (Yes, more housing too. It will be a theme of the SNP election campaign.)",
