Stained glass windows and ceilings have been restored, while the public will be able to visit the dining room and butler's pantry for the first time. Councillor Kate Butler, from Stockport Council, called it the 'jewel in the crown' of the town's heritage. The manor dates back to the reign of William the Conqueror when he bestowed the lands upon one of his followers, Hamon de Masci, who became the first Baron of Dunham Massey. Since then the estate has been under the ownership of just three families: the Davenports, De Bromales and Nevills. In 1936, the timber-framed hall and its surrounding parkland was handed over to the local council. The transformation followed a £1.6m grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and £400,000 in council funding.",

Defence counsel Shelagh McCall QC told the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh that the Crown conceded there was insufficient evidence to prove lack of consent on the coercion charge. The Lord Justice Clerk, Lady Dorrian, who heard the appeal with Lady Paton and Lord Turnbull, said: 'We are satisfied the concession is well made.' Lord Turnbull said that information conveyed to the court seemed to show that even at an earlier preparatory marking stage in the case there were concerns over a lack of corroboration. Mr Weatherhogg, of Guthrie, near Forfar, Angus, had denied the charges during the trial, but admitted a separate charge of uploading the film to the internet. He was jailed for four-and-years by Lady Wolffe with an additional 18 months for the charge he admitted. The appeal hearing was told that Mr Weatherhogg had been in custody since March last year and had served the 18 month sentence, taking into account early release provisions.",

The father of two, 31, has denied the charge at the Old Bailey in London. Using an online alias, Ali allegedly tried to order 500mg of the deadly toxin, the jury was told, which would have been enough to kill 1,400 people. As 'Weirdos 0000', Ali contacted a man on the black market and placed an order for the ricin, the court heard. He went on to negotiate the deal in encrypted exchanges unaware the United States-based 'dealer' was actually an FBI agent who alerted the British authorities. On 10 February, he took delivery of a toy car with 'special batteries' at the home he shared with his wife and two young sons. But instead of ricin, the five concealed packets contained a harmless powder and Ali was arrested.",

    "source": "According to three separate analyses, a flood of automated comments to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was detected over the weekend.\nMore than 400,000 comments with remarkably similar wording have been detected in recent days.\nNet neutrality proponents argue that all internet traffic should be equal.\nThis means that no content provider should be able to, for example, charge more for faster access to certain data.\nOne expert described bot activity as a new form of protest.\n\"Someone has gone out of their way to make these seem like real submissions,\" wrote Chris Sinchok in a blog post about the apparently automated activity.\nHaving downloaded the comments and associated data, Mr Sinchok noticed that the names and email addresses associated with thousands of them also turned up in lists of personal data stolen from websites.\nHe told the BBC that this suggested someone might be using information collected from breached databases to make the submissions look more authentic.\n\"It really seems like this is getting pooled from some place in an automated fashion and it's coming in at unreasonable rates,\" he said.\nHe added that the uniformity of the data was also a possible giveaway.\nFor example, many comments are essentially identical save for the occasional, small difference - such as the exact same sentence appearing in multiple comments, but with different letters capitalised each time.\nAnd the rate at which comments were posted also seemed suspicious, starting and stopping in bursts, he added.\nOther watchers, including a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and another at Harvard University, have also tracked a boom in apparently automated activity directed at the site in recent days.\nEarlier this month, the FCC said it had been targeted by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that led to downtime for the comments system.\nThis followed a television appearance by comedian John Oliver in which he urged people to post comments against the proposals on the FCC's website.\n\"Net neutrality is such a hot-button issue and it's one of the few examples of online activism that's actually amounted to something,\" noted Prof Phil Howard at the Oxford Internet Institute.\nHe cited the 2014 online protests, after which President Obama stepped in to recommend that the FCC drop earlier proposals to curtail net neutrality.\n\"This is how people protest these days,\" said Prof Howard, referring to the apparently automated comments.\nHe also pointed out that a growing number of people had the necessary programming skills to do it.\nHowever, Mr Sinchok is concerned that the bot activity will create the impression that genuine opposition to the FCC's current proposals does not really exist.\n\"There are people that care about this issue a lot,\" he told the BBC.\n\"Activity like this is really muddying the waters - and I don't want it to give [the FCC] an excuse to say, 'Hey, there's mixed support for this.'\"\nThe FCC has not yet responded to a BBC request for comment.",

    "source": "Schools are asked to create a dedicated page on their school website and send the web address (or URL) to schoolreport@bbc.co.uk and we will link to it from the map of participating schools.\nYou can use the official School Report graphics, which can be found at the foot of this page.\nThen, on School Report News Day on 16 March 2017, schools can upload their reports to their websites.\nHere are some frequently asked questions and answers about setting up web pages.\nIf you're not technically minded, don't worry! The best thing to do is to speak early on to your school's IT department or the people who look after the school website.\nYou need to create a dedicated School Report web page on the school website so that people can find the students' work. It has to be accessible to the public, so don't use internal websites (or intranets) or pages that need a password.\nUntil your pupils' reports are ready, the page should contain a \"holding\" or \"come back later\" message. You can copy and paste this:\nStudents from this school will be making the news for real on 16 March 2017 as they take part in BBC News School Report. We aim to publish the news by 1600 GMT on News Day, so please save this page as a favourite and return to it later.\nHave a click through to examples from our School Report map if you want an idea of how other schools have gone about it.\nOnce the page is live, email the web address (URL) to the School Report team via schoolreport@bbc.co.uk so we can link to your webpage.\nAs soon as possible! It saves a lot of hassle in the busy run-up to News Day when you and the School Reporters would probably rather be focusing on getting great interviews than sorting out technical issues.\nAs soon as your page is ready, the School Report team can link to your website from the map of participating schools. - as long as both pieces of School Report paperwork have been returned!\nOnce live, some schools use the page to reflect what's happening in the build-up to the News Day, for example adding team photos and encouraging pupils to post news reporting ideas.\nNo. It is important to create a dedicated web page, so the BBC can link directly to the students' journalistic work. The fewer the clicks, the more likely you are to retain the audience.\nAlso, after the News Day, the homepage of a school website will inevitably change, but creating a dedicated page means there is a permanent record of their work.\nYes. If your school has participated in School Report in previous years, you can use the existing web page, but remember to label it clearly.\nRemember, you risk losing people's attention if they think your web page is out of date. A simple message at the top of the page can be helpful, such as the example mentioned above.\nIf you can't publish School Report content on your school website, all is not lost!\nYou could look at hosting stories on another website that you consider appropriate and that is in line with your school's policy. See if your local council or academy sponsor could help host your content.\nSome schools have used websites such as Makewaves, a website designed to host video and audio material for educational purposes.\nYou could create a web page using a number of different programmes, with many people using software such as Microsoft Expression or Adobe Dreamweaver.\nIf you do use a site other than your school site, check the terms and conditions to make sure it is suitable for 11 to 16-year-olds and that there are no advertisements on the site.\nThe golden rule is to use first names only. For child protection reasons, the BBC cannot link to a page which contains the surnames of anyone younger than 18. This also applies to blog entries and comments posted on the page.\nRefer to the School Report guidelines on staying safe and legal which highlight some of the issues anyone should consider when publishing content which features children. This page also offers guidance about media law issues such as copyright, libel and contempt of court as well as editorial issues such as taste and decency.\nBe aware that the BBC website is very popular. By virtue of a link from the BBC, students will have a large audience but people will also be able to access other pages on the school website.\nAt the bottom of this page, there are some School Report graphics you can use on your dedicated web page. However, they can only be used by schools who have completed their paperwork, and within the context of the project.\nIt is also a good idea to incorporate the design of your school website to create a uniform look.\nIt is best to avoid a design which relies on large pictures as it will make pages slow to download and could put off potential viewers. However, you might like to add photographs of students taking part in School Report or the school logo.\nOur agreement with the head teacher of every school taking part explicitly states that the school, not the BBC, is responsible for the school website. Teachers need to decide on the most suitable way of hosting content according to their school's social media, internet safety and child protection policies.\nFor this reason, we are happy to link to school websites which use YouTube (or similar video-sharing websites) to embed content, provided the school website complies with our guidelines in all other ways. We will not, however, link directly to YouTube.\nSome schools have used websites such as Makewaves, a website designed to host video and audio material for educational purposes.\nProviding the school website complies with our guidelines in all other ways, we are happy to link to school websites containing links to social media.\nGenerally though, we do not recommend including links to social media websites such as Facebook and Twitter from your school website, as they are designed to be used by children aged 13 or over. There is a risk of students experiencing cyberbullying via such sites.\nIf your school website contains an automated Twitter feed, you may want to look into deactivating it or at least monitoring it during the busy time around News Day.\nA dedicated page means the audience can find students' work easily and quickly. It also provides a  permanent archive of students' reports and makes it clear that the reports are new and not from previous years. The page can also help avoid any potential child protection issues.\nRight click the images, and select Save Picture As.",

It will now hold a series of meetings across Wales as it tries to rally members for an election that it'll be able to fight unshackled of being in coalition government which was clearly a burden to many of them.",

    "source": "In a speech he said, given the effects of the referendum vote, the government had to be \"realistic about achieving a surplus by the end of the decade\".\nThe target had been the chancellor's most prized goal and had been driving austerity measures in previous budgets.\nBut he said the economy is showing \"clear signs\" of shock following the vote to leave the European Union.\nGiving a speech in Manchester, Mr Osborne said: \"The referendum is expected to produce a significant negative economic shock to our economy. How we respond will determine the impact on jobs and growth.\n\"We must provide fiscal credibility, continuing to be tough on the deficit while being realistic about achieving a surplus by the end of the decade.\"\nLabour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell welcomed the move, saying: \"Sadly the vote last Thursday for Brexit has only brought forward what was inevitable.\n\"The Chancellor had already dropped his other fiscal rules on welfare and debt at the Budget in March, and according to many economists he was expected to be forced to drop this one too.\"\nBBC business editor Kamal Ahmed says that the target was heading for the \"Treasury shredding machine\" following a speech from Home Secretary Theresa May yesterday.\nIn a speech launching her bid to become prime minister she said \"we should no longer seek to reach a budget surplus by the end of the parliament\".\nKamal says that Mr Osborne has now followed suit.\nNevertheless, the Treasury insists that it still wants to balance the books and \"fix the finances\".\nMr Osborne first committed himself to returning the national finances to surplus by 2020 at the Conservative Party conference in 2013 and it became policy in the July budget of 2015.\nBut there have been questions ever since over whether that target could be met.\nEven before the referendum vote he only had \"a slightly better than 50/50 chance\" of making the target said Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.\nBut the uncertainty caused by the Leave vote could hold back the economy and make creating a surplus even more difficult.\n\"Having voted for Brexit last week, the economy is clearly going to go into a downswing, that might be a full-blown recession, that might just be very very low growth,\" said Paul Johnson the director of the IFS.\nIt is sometimes easy in these incredible political times to forget that for most people \"it's the economy, stupid\" still holds true.\nFor the UK economy, one of the most important passages of Theresa May's speech yesterday was when she signalled that George Osborne's \"fiscal rule\" (to produce a budget surplus by 2020) was for the Treasury shredding machine.\n\"While it is absolutely vital that the government continues with its intention to reduce public spending and cut the budget deficit, we should no longer seek to reach a budget surplus by the end of the parliament,\" Mrs May said.\nNow the chancellor has said he agrees, arguing that the government must be \"realistic\" about its fiscal targets and that austerity policies could be eased.\nMy Treasury sources point out that the \"rule\" can be varied in \"non-normal\" times.\nAnd these are pretty \"non-normal\" times.\nThe abandonment of the fiscal target suggests the government could borrow more, presumably for investment in infrastructure and to mitigate the need for tax rises and spending cuts, if the economy does take a turn for the worse as some predict.\nMore from Kamal: Brexit and the easing of austerity\nThe Tories have been in turmoil since David Cameron announced his intention to resign following the UK's vote in favour on leaving the European Union.\nIn a shock development on Thursday, Boris Johnson, widely seen as the frontrunner to become prime minister, announced that he would not be running.\nThe BBC has learned that Justice Secretary Michael Gove is now coming under growing pressure to abandon his bid to become Tory leader.\nSources have told the BBC government ministers are trying to persuade the justice secretary to give way so the party can \"unite\" around Home Secretary Theresa May.\nMr Gove opted to stand after switching his support from Boris Johnson.\nIn a speech, Mr Gove said his decision to stand to become Conservative leader is driven by \"conviction\" about what is right for the UK not personal ambition.\nThree other candidates have put their names forward for the Conservative leadership: Energy Minister Andrea Leadsom, MP Liam Fox and Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb.\nThe government borrowed Â£74.9bn in the 2015/2016 fiscal year and for the financial year so far - covering April and May - borrowing reached Â£17.9bn, Â£0.2bn higher than the same period a year ago.\nIt is thought that the government will now raise borrowing, so it can avoid further cuts in spending or raising taxes. It could also borrow to invest in big building projects.\n\"The problem of course is, you can't borrow forever,\"said Paul Johnson from the IFS.\n\"So we'll have a few more years of more borrowing, but my guess is this is not the end of austerity, actually this means austerity will just go on for longer because we'll probably have the spending cuts and tax rises right through the 2020s to pay for this.\"",

It will be done on Tuesday,\" he said.\nIn addition to the Port Talbot factory - the UK's largest steelworks - Tata's remaining assets include sites at Newport, where more than 1,300 people are employed, and Rotherham, which employs 1,200. Tata also has operations at Corby, Shotton and Teesside.\nMacquarie, the Australian bank, was advising Liberty on a potential bid, and is considered a potential financial backer of any takeover.\nLiberty House started life in the university room of Indian-born founder Sanjeev Gupta.\nWhile a student at Cambridge University in 1992, the budding entrepreneur started what has since become a global steel and commodities business with annual sales of more than £2bn.\nWith operations in 30 countries, and headquarters in London, Dubai, and Singapore, Mr Gupta's Liberty has also emerged as a possible saviour of Britain's steel industry.\nLiberty's focus is on recycling the mountains of scrap metal generated in the UK, rather than the historical method of producing steel in blast furnaces.\nLast month, it acquired Tata Steel's plants in Lanarkshire. In recent years, it has reached similar deals for steel plants in Newport and the Black Country.\nA management buyout team is also planning to submit a bid under the name Excalibur Steel UK Limited.\nIt has appointed investment banker Mark Rhydderch-Roberts as a non-executive director. He joins Stuart Wilkie, the head of Tata's United Kingdom strip steel business, and former Alcan senior executive and venture capitalist Roger Maggs, on the board.\nThe government has promised to support any buyer of the business by taking up to a 25% stake in a new business and making hundreds of millions of pounds of finance available.\nTata has not publicly set a deadline for any deal, but has made it clear it cannot sustain its £1m-a-day losses indefinitely and does not want to prolong the uncertainty for workers and customers.\nTata's Scunthorpe operation, which employs more than 3,000 people, has been sold to investment firm Greybull Capital for a nominal £1.",

And if the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn wins he would also claim endorsement for placing his own political priorities at the centre of the talks to come.\nBut in European terms, that's something of a secondary issue.\nThe EU Commission's lead negotiator, Michel Barnier, is going to have to deal with whoever is in residence in 10 Downing Street and the strength of the occupant's mandate won't be his concern.\nHis team have already said that while the announcement doesn't change anything, there's a hope that it will produce a strong leader with strong backing from the people of the UK.\nAnd we can be sure this British election will be watched with even closer attention than usual - not just in Brussels but in the other European capitals where Brexit is going to be a huge issue in the years to come.\nFirst, both Theresa May and all her rivals will have to set out their visions for Brexit in much more detail than we've heard so far.\nBritish voters will demand nothing less.\nBut in the process, the Barnier team and the governments of France, Germany and the rest will get a feeling for where the British red lines in negotiations really lie.\nAny British candidate worth his or her salt will try to leave room for manoeuvre in the talks to come after the election, but it will surely be impossible to campaign without giving away at least some detail.\nAnd of course there are romantics across Europe who hope that the voice of the Remainers will be heard loud and clear in the British debate to come.\nThe hope that Brexit might be quickly reversed has pretty much faded from the European debate now, but plenty of politicians across the continent will be hoping to hear candidates putting forward the argument for a soft Brexit with the closest possible links to the EU and its single market.\nThat may be wishful thinking, but there'll be strong support for such voices from many quarters in Europe.\nEurope was taken by surprise by Theresa May's announcement, but not taken aback. The EU negotiators have been working hard behind the scenes to prepare their position and their message is that they're ready to negotiate with Britain, no matter who occupies 10 Downing Street.\nThis was already a busy year for European democracy - the Netherlands has already voted, while France votes for a president at the weekend and will hold National Assembly elections in June.\nGermany goes to the polls in September.\nBut there's an awareness that the UK election will be different precisely because it will play a huge part in shaping the British negotiating position on Brexit.\nAnd, of course, there's also the fascination of the pure political theatre of it all.",

By comparison, the eurozone recorded growth of just 0.7% over the same period.\nAlong with Greece, Spain and Portugal, Ireland was among the eurozone's worst hit economies, with the bursting of its property bubble and soaring unemployment.\nThe 1.5% quarterly rise beat the 0.5% expected by economists polled in a survey by the Reuters news agency.\nMr Noonan said the faster growth would mean Ireland's budget deficit falling to about 3.5% of GDP this year against a target of 4.8%. That meant 2bn euros of tax rises and spending cuts planned for next year would no longer be needed to reach the EU limit of 3% by the end of 2015, he said.\nThe economic improvement comes after years of austerity, a bailout from international lenders, and relentless austerity measures.\n\"At face value, the numbers suggest that the boom is back,\" said Austin Hughes, chief economist at KBC Bank Ireland.\n\"It shows a clearly improving economy. It's very encouraging to see the improvement in consumption, in construction. So a domestic recovery is taking hold, if a lot less intense that the headline number would suggest,\" he said.",
