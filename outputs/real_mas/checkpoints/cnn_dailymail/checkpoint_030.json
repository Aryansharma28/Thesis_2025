    "source": "(The Hollywood Reporter)Richard Dysart, the Emmy-winning actor who portrayed the cranky senior partner Leland McKenzie in the slick, long-running NBC drama \"L.A. Law,\" has died. He was 86. Dysart, who also played Coach in the original 1972 Broadway production of Jason Miller's Pulitzer Prize-winning \"That Championship Season,\" died Sunday at home in Santa Monica after a long illness, his wife, artist Kathryn Jacobi, told The Hollywood Reporter. The acclaimed \"L.A. Law\" — created by Steven Bochco (who eventually handed off the series to David E. Kelley) and Terry Louise Fisher — aired for eight seasons from 1986 to 1994. For playing the founder of the firm McKenzie, Brackman, Chaney and Kuzak, Dysart was nominated for the Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series for four straight years, finally winning the trophy in 1992. \"I always had him in mind for that role,\" Bochco said in a 2002 interview with the Archive of American Television. \"He's so avuncular. So I reached out to him. You know, Dick is sort of an old hippie. So he went into his closet and tried to find a lawyer outfit, and he came to meet us wearing a suit and tie. He was perfect.\" \"We got together, mapped out the character's past to give us a basis from which to work, and it's all gone smoothly since then,\" Dysart said in a 1990 interview with The Seattle Times. \"Sometimes I worry — it's all been going too well — a role I love to play in a series that's about as good as you can get. Something's wrong!\" Perhaps Dysart's most memorable character arc on the show was when he was found in bed with power-hungry competitor Rosalind Shays (played by Diana Muldaur). He was one of the few actors to appear in every episode. Dysart's range of authority -figure parts ran right to the top. He limned Harry Truman in the CBS telefilm \"Day One\" and in the ABC miniseries \"War and Remembrance,\" both of which aired in 1989, and he was Henry L. Stimson, the 33rd U.S. president's Secretary of War, in the 1995 HBO telefilm \"Truman,\" starring Gary Sinise. Similarly, he played the Secretary of Defense in \"Meteor\" (1979). Hollywood Reporter: Most powerful people in N.Y. media . Dysart also performed extensively in the medical- (movie) field, performing enough doctor roles to, perhaps, qualify to practice. His two most memorable came in classic satires: in Paddy Chayevsky's scathing \"The Hospital\" (1971), starring George C. Scott (a good friend), and in \"Being There\" (1979), as Melvyn Douglas' doctor. He also was a doctor who died a gruesome death in John Carpenter's \"The Thing\" (1982) and a physician in such films as \"The Terminal Man\" (1974), \"The Falcon and the Snowman\" (1985) and \"Warning Sign\" (1985). Dysart portrayed J. Edgar Hoover in the 1993 USA telefilm \"Marilyn & Bobby: Her Final Affair\" and in Mario Van Peebles' \"Panther\" (1995). Dysart also excelled as cranky coots and shifty sorts. He portrayed a motel receptionist in Richard Lester's \"Petulia\" (1968); was the bad guy who battled Clint Eastwood in \"Pale Rider\" (1985); stood out as a power player in Oliver Stone's \"Wall Street\" (1987); and sold barbwire in \"Back to the Future III\" (1990). Dysart was born March 30, 1929, in Boston and raised in Maine. Following high school, he attended the Gould Academy in Bethel, Maine, for a year, served in the U.S. Air Force and attended Emerson College, where he graduated with a master's degree in speech communications. At the time, he was interested in a career in radio (he became fascinated with the medium in first grade, when he was bedridden for a year because of rheumatic fever) but was soon tempted by acting. He moved to New York on a whim and was able to land minor roles on TV and a part in an off-Broadway production of \"The Iceman Cometh\" opposite Jason Robards. In the mid-1960s, he joined the American Conservatory Theater and toured the country doing plays, then landed roles on Broadway in \"All in Good Time,\" \"The Little Foxes\" and \"A Place Without Doors.\" He received a Drama Desk Award for his performance in \"That Championship Season.\" Hollywood Reporter: Q&A with Liz Smith . Dysart's credits include an eclectic array of movies, including \"The Crazy World of Julius Vrooder\" (1974), \"The Day of the Locust\" (1975), \"The Hindenburg\" (1975), \"An Enemy of the People\" (1978), \"Prophecy\" (1979), \"Mask\" (1985) and \"Hard Rain\" (1998). On television, he was top-notch in the telefilms \"The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman\" (1974), \"The People vs. Jean Harris\" (1981), as Dwight D. Eisenhower in \"The Last Days of Patton\" (1986) and as studio chief Louis B. Mayer in \"Malice in Wonderland\" (1985). Survivors also include his stepson Arie and daughter-in-law Jeannine Jacobi, mother-in-law Lenore, brother and sister-in-law Nadine and John Jacobi and grandchildren Abby and Levi. A private memorial is being planned. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made to the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum, an outdoor theater in Topanga Canyon in the Los Angeles area. Dysart and Jacobi had a second home in the forests of British Columbia. He was lured out of retirement for his last onscreen appearance, the \"L.A. Law\" reunion telefilm of 2002. \"They remain timely, with cases about points of law that are still current,\" he said of watching \"L.A. Law\" reruns in a 2002 interview with The Bangor Daily News. \"[The show] was also one of the fathers of yuppiedom. It was very much of the times, and very Los Angeles. It holds up as well as any series I know.\" People we've lost in 2015 . ©2015 The Hollywood Reporter. All rights reserved.",

Umpires ejected a total of five players from both teams after the fight in the seventh inning of Thursday's game at Chicago's U.S. Cellular Field,  Illinois. A heated exchange between Royals starter Yordano Ventura and White Sox outfielder Adam Eaton sparked the brawl which saw players from both dugouts and bullpens flood the field, reported New York Daily News. Chicago White Sox's Jeff Samardzija, center, in the brawl with Kansas City Royals players during the seventh inning of Thursday's game . Several punches were thrown and  Ventura, along with fellow teammates Lorenzo Cain and Edinson Volquez, was sent off along with Chicago's Chris Sale and Jeff Samardzija. Thursday's match began to get scrappy after the White Sox's Jose Abreu was hit in the arm by  Ventura's pitch in the fourth inning. The very next inning, Royals' Mike Moustakas was also hit in the arm, this time by a pitch from Chris Sale, leading to a warning for both teams. But things continued to escalate until Eaton hit a comebacker (a ball batted directly back to the pitcher) at Ventura in the seventh inning. The Royals starter picked up a ground ball but instead of throwing it to first for the out, he appeared to stop for a moment and stare at the pitcher. Umpires ejected a total of five players from both teams after the fight after the seventh inning of Thursday's game at Chicago's U.S. Cellular Field, Illinois . The pair exchanged words, and Eaton is alleged to have shouted an expletive at Ventura, who was said to have shouted one back before he threw to first base to end the inning. Things quickly turned ugly and both players had to be kept apart by teammates and umpires. But the whole of both teams ran onto the field for the brawl where there was pushing, shoving and even a few punches. The fight was beginning to calm down and Moustakas was escorting Ventura back to the dugout when Samardzija charged at Cain. However, he missed knocked over coach Mike Jirschele instead. Ventura told ESPN Chicago he regretted the way he'd handled himself. 'It was a messy situation, I got the ground ball and was unable to control my emotions in that play, and it turned out ugly,' Ventura said. Several punches were thrown and Kansas City's Ventura, Lorenzo Cain and Edinson Volquez were ejected along with Chicago's Chris Sale and Jeff Samardzija (pictured going down) The whole of both teams ran onto the field for the brawl where there was pushing, shoving and even a few punches in the brawl . '(Eaton) said something to me. I responded back to him,' he said. 'It wasn't my intention, but maybe he interpreted it from the way I fielded the ball, but it was a hard comebacker, kind of put me off-balance, at which point I took those steps that incited him and he responded back, clearly emotional.' Royals won the game 3-2 in 13 innings, which is the first of a four-game series. This is not the first time the Royals have had tensions with other teams. Last weekend, their clash with Oakland Athletics landed scrappy Ventura with a fine for his actions. He was also  involved in the team's disagreements with the Los Angeles Angels. In the three-game series against the Athletics, the teams clashed almost every match until five players and coaches were thrown out of the finale. They included Royals reliever Kelvin Herrera, who threw that fastball behind the head of Brett  Lawrie and pointed to his own head in a threatening manner. He received a five-game suspension.",

    "source": "Accused: Retired general Sir Frank Kitson (above) won a CBE for his service in the Army . A retired general is being sued over a murder in Northern Ireland more than 40 years ago. Sir Frank Kitson, who is 88, is accused in the case of Patrick Eugene Heenan, a Catholic killed by loyalists in 1973. It is the first time a retired senior officer has been personally sued over the Troubles. Yesterday however, Sir Frank said he was confused as to why he was being named because he was not even serving in Northern Ireland at the time. He learned of the legal action in a letter from a Belfast law firm at the weekend. Mr Heenan, 47, was killed when paramilitaries threw a grenade at a minibus carrying him and 14 others to a Belfast building site. His widow, Mary, is suing the Ministry of Defence and the general, claiming he died because of ‘negligence and misfeasance’. But Sir Frank told the Daily Mail he had no connection to the case. ‘I wasn’t even there in 1973,’ he said. ‘I was in Ireland from September 1970 until April 1972. I know nothing about what happened to Mr Heenan. 'I wasn’t a policy maker, I was a commander of troops. I have absolutely no knowledge of Mr Heenan and I had gone from Ireland at the time of his death.’ Baffled: Sir Frank (pictured), who is now 88, said he was confused as to why he was being named because he was not even serving in Northern Ireland at the time of the murder in 1973 . Sir Frank also denied the claim that he was in charge of military operations in Northern Ireland during the early 1970s: ‘I was not. ‘I was commanding one of three brigades. Above me there was a major general and a lieutenant general. ‘We were working very closely with the police at the time, we have to make our plans together. We never instigated the use of paramilitary gangs.’ Colonel Tim Collins – formerly of the 1st Battalion Royal Irish Regiment – described the decision to pursue General Kitson as strange. He added: ‘Not only is it a strange case, it worries me that such an action is allowed by the authorities and the Government. ‘What is also of concern is that there are people out there who are set to profit by taking cases such as these.’ Kevin Winters, of law firm KRW, said: ‘This week we have issued proceedings against the MoD and Frank Kitson on behalf of our clients, the relatives of Patrick Heenan. 'These are civil proceedings for damages but their core value is to obtain truth and accountability for our clients as to the role of the British Army and Frank Kitson in the counter-insurgency operation in the north of Ireland during the early part of the conflict.’ Royal appointment: Sir Frank (far right) is pictured with the Queen, Major General Patrick Palmer (centre), and Lieutenant General Sir Edward Burgess (left) during a visit to York in May 1983 . He claimed loyalist paramilitary gangs were ‘core to the Kitson military doctrine endorsed by the British Army and the British government at the time’. Eugene Heenan, son of the murdered man, said he and his 88-year-old mother would travel to London on Thursday to generate publicity for the civil action. He added: ‘Kitson may not have been in Ireland when my father was murdered but those who did were working to a template he had developed while in various countries and it is him who has to be held accountable.’ Sir Frank has been named co-defendant in the legal action on grounds that he and others used agents when they knew, or should have known, that they would take part in criminal actions. He was awarded a CBE in February 1972 for ‘gallant and distinguished’ services in Northern Ireland from August 1971 to November 1971. He enjoyed a distinguished career, serving in Oman and Malaya and in Kenya during the Mau Mau rebellion, for which he received the Military Cross in 1955. The general rose to become commander-in-chief UK land forces from 1982 to 1985. Former soldier Albert ‘Ginger’ Baker received a life sentence for killing Mr Heenan and three others but he later claimed to have links to British intelligence. He was a member of the outlawed Ulster Defence Association and known to be a leading member of the so-called ‘Romper Room’ gang. Although no inquest was held into Mr Heenan’s death, it has been claimed he could have survived had first aid been given quickly.",

The charge came to light when customers sought to claim money back from travel insurers after French air-traffic strikes affected flights earlier this month. They were asked to provide an airline letter confirming the cancellation, but easyJet told its hard-hit passengers to pay a £10 fee. Scroll down for video . Compensation: The charge came to light when easyJet customers sought to claim money back from travel insurers after French air-traffic strikes affected flights earlier this month. Above, file image . The Association of European Airlines confirmed last night that no other airline has attempted to charge for this and said customers should not be charged. However, a spokesman for easyJet defended the airline’s position, saying: ‘The administration charge for the letter is applied because each letter has to be individually researched and created for each passenger.’ In an email seen by the Mail in response to one customer’s request, easyJet’s customer service team said: ‘We can certainly send you a letter to help you claim on your insurance, that’s not a problem. ‘There is a small administration fee of 10GBP for the letter, which you should be able to claim back through your insurer.’ There were delays and 1,000 flight cancellations across Europe this month following the 48-hour strike by French air-traffic controllers. EasyJet is France’s second-largest airline and cancelled 588 flights over the two days. The airline launched ‘rescue flights’ to repatriate holidaymakers and children stranded abroad. Ryanair cancelled 500 flights while British Airways and Flybe cancelled fewer than 50 each. Travel chaos: There were delays and 1,000 flight cancellations across Europe this month following the 48-hour strike by French air-traffic controllers. Pictured, passengers queue for check-in at Stansted Airport . And flight cancellations have risen by a fifth in the first quarter of 2015 as services were hit by poor weather as well as the strikes. There were 5,080 cancellations in the first three months of 2015 compared to 4,239 in the same period last year. The number of delayed flights increased by 7 per cent with 2,427 hold-ups compared to 2,260. Monarch had the greatest increase in delays – 30 per cent – with 64 incidents, according to figures from compensation firm EUClaim. Strikes: Ryanair cancelled 500 flights while British Airways and Flybe cancelled fewer than 50 each. Above, a flight information board at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, where several flights were cancelled . EasyJet has seen a 19 per cent increase with 245 delays in the first four months of this year compared to 206 last year. The EUClaim report said: ‘There are two main reasons for the poor start to the year. Firstly the winter weather across Europe has been worse than 2014 this particularly affected Jet2, easyJet and Monarch who suffered considerable delays on their routes to Chambery and Grenoble in France. ‘The second cause has been the number of strikes in Europe. The four-day Lufthansa strike resulted in some 116 cancelled flights to the UK, strikes by Italian air traffic controllers and security staff in Germany has also compounded the problem.’",

So it was only a matter of time before the make-up industry jumped on the bandwagon. The newest generation of beauty products will be personalised to meet all your particular needs - from bespoke mascaras and eyeliners to foundations and powders unique to you. Scroll down for video . The newest generation of beauty products will be personalised to meet all your particular needs . Eyeko London's Bespoke Mascara (£28) comes in dozens of brush shapes . Eyeko London is just one brand taking advantage of the trend with the launch of its new Bespoke Mascara (£28), offering more than 100 different combinations of brush shape and formula to suit your lashes. At Eyeko's Bespoke Eye Wardrobe in London's Harvey Nichols, which launched earlier this month, customers can choose between dozens of brush shapes - from thick wands for a dramatic Sixties look to skinnier ones for lengthened, separated lashes. The mascaras, containing natural ingredients like conditioning shea butter and hydrating keratin, are created on site and then wrapped in monogrammed packaging to complete the personalised theme. Co-founder Nina Leykind said: 'It's like the Baskin Robbins of mascara. Getting it right is about the combination. One doesn’t work without the other. 'Even if you have an amazing brush for you, if it’s put together with the wrong formula then it doesn’t work.' Foundation, too, is set to see a surge in personalisation. Beauty brands have long promised customised foundation, but finding that perfect shade and texture is easier said than done. Enter Cover FX Custom Cover Drops (£36) a new game-changing alternative to foundation which can transform your entire make-up collection. Cover Drops, which are based on a colour palette of neutral, pink and gold, can be mixed with any of your favourite moisturisers, oils, serums or other foundations to create your preferred texture and finish. Using 'Flash Fusion' technology, as soon as the drops are added to a beauty product, they blend in flawlessly, leaving behind only pure pigments and instant tint. Cover FX Custom Cover Drops (£36) can be mixed with any of your favourite moisturizers, oils, serums or other foundations to create your preferred texture and finish . It's not just make-up that is increasingly becoming tailored to your personal needs. Skincare brand Jennifer Young offers customised moisturisers, serums, cleansers and toners made with the particular ingredients that your skin craves. Customers who visit the Jennifer Young website specify their gender, age, problem areas, preferred scent and skin sensitivities, among other options. They are then presented with a selection of made-to-order products designed to enhance their particular skin type, with prices starting at £20 for a custom-made toner. Not only are beauty brands creating more and more customised products, but shops and department stores are also taking note of the bespoke trend by launching services to help customers create their own blends. Harvey Nichols' newly-launched Beauty Concierge (pictured) is  a personal shopping service  for make-up . Harvey Nichols' newly-launched Beauty Concierge, for instance, is like a personal shopping service specifically for make-up. Customers who book a complimentary appointment meet with a Beauty Adviser, whose mission it is to seek out your ideal lipstick, fragrance or skincare, with no bias towards particular brands. According to Daniela Rinaldi, group beauty buying director at Harvey Nichols, bespoke products are most certainly the future of beauty - and customisation is only going to get bigger. 'I think the one size fits all concept just simply doesn’t cater to customers’ individual needs at all times anymore,' she explained. 'Whilst there is still definitely a market for ready-to-wear beauty, we are seeing an increase in our customers wanting to know that the product they are using is right for them; many don’t want to learn this through a process of trial and error.'",

The firm will show off the watch to the public for the first time from tomorrow at its retail stores and several special popup stores around the world. From tomorrow morning, customers will be able to preorder their watch online. Scroll down for video . Apple Watch, available for pre-order on Friday, April 10, 2015, comes with a choice of watch case, band and size _ there are 54 possible configurations in all. If you know the specific configuration you want, you're best off ordering it online, starting at 12:01 a.m. PDT Friday (3:01 a.m. EDT). They will start to ship on April 24. Popular models might not be available right away if you're not among the first to order. Your watch will get shipped to you. There won't be an in-store pick-up option. 'We are excited to welcome customers tomorrow and introduce them to Apple Watch, our most personal device yet.said Angela Ahrendts, Apple's senior vice president of Retail and Online Stores. 'Based on the tremendous interest from people visiting our stores, as well as the number of customers who have gone to the Apple Online Store to mark their favourite Apple Watch ahead of availability, we expect that strong customer demand will exceed our supply at launch,' 'To provide the best experience and selection to as many customers as we can, we will be taking orders for Apple Watch exclusively online during the initial launch period.' Customers in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, the UK and the US can try on and experience Apple Watch at their local Apple Store or at Galeries Lafayette in Paris, Isetan in Tokyo, Selfridges in London, and select Apple Authorised Resellers in Japan and China. Customers can pre-order their Apple Watch through the Apple Online Store beginning April 10 at 8:01 a.m. BST for delivery beginning April 24. In stores, customers will get a personalised session with a Specialist to try on, fit and size their band, and explore the amazing features of Apple Watch. Apple says it encourages customers who want to try on an Apple Watch are encouraged to make an appointment online at www.apple.com. Pre-orders begin April 10 at 8:01 a.m. BST through the Apple Online Store and the Apple Store app for iPhone and iPad. Customers who pre-order their Apple Watch can have it shipped for delivery beginning April 24. The watch, when paired with an iPhone, allows users to check email, listen to music and make phone calls. 'Will the Apple Watch change your life? Well, possibly more than many realise until they start using it. 'After a day or two with the watch, a strange thing happened - I completely stopped checking my phone. 'While Apple may be the firm that really creates phone addiction, meaning we are constantly checking our handsets, with the Apple Watch it may have cured it. 'Apple undoubtedly has another hit on its hands with the watch. 'As more and more apps appear, and developers actually get to spend time with it, I fully expect it be used in ways we can’t even imagine now. 'Much like the iPhone, apps could propel this to become a new computing platform - and even with the features it already has, the Apple watch is the most elegant way to communicate digitally.' 'Starting Friday, customers can try on Apple Watch, Apple Watch Sport or Apple Watch Edition to find the model with the size, finish and band to best fit their personal preference and style,' the firm explained. 'Everyone visiting an Apple Store will be able to view all three collections and get hands on with Apple Watch Demo to browse and edit different watch faces, and learn about Apple Watch's health and fitness features, Digital Touch, Siri and more.' Based on a survey in the United States on consumer interest in buying the Apple Watch, BMO Capital Markets has cut its estimate for sales to 39 million units though September 2016. Previously, the analysts had estimated sales of 55.5 million units. About 735 people responded to the survey. Apple is among several companies, including Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Sony Corp, that are jumping into the nascent market for wearable devices. The watch, when paired with an iPhone, allows users to check email, listen to music and make phone calls. Faces on the watch can be customised, and users will be shown this in strore . There is also an app that helps people monitor their health, for example by tracking heartbeats and footsteps. 'We believe in the next five years, the watch will revolutionize the way we interact with objects around us,' Oppenheimer analysts wrote a note on Thursday. Apple shares were up 0.3 percent at $125.98 in early trading on Thursday. Each version of the watch will come in different colour options. Apple's Watch goes on display around the world on 10 April and people can pre-order it at 12.01 Pacific Time (8am BST) on this day. The Watch will then go on general sale on 24 April in the US, UK, Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong and Japan . Apple Watch comes with a choice of watch case, band and size — there are 54 possible configurations in all. Most models come in two sizes, 38 millimeters and 42 millimeters, as measured by the height of the watch face. The larger one costs $50 more in most cases. For a few of the bands, only one size is available. There are three lines to choose from: . The sport, Watch and Edition versions of the smart timepiece . The cheapest is a 'Sport' version with an aluminum case. You can get it with a silver case and choose a white, blue, green or pink band made of synthetic rubber. Or get a grey case with a black band. The smaller version costs $349, and the large one is $399. That's 10 configurations — five bands, each in two sizes. The regular version has a stainless steel case. The cheapest has the same band as the Sport version. You choose white or black and pay $549 for the smaller model and $599 for large. Fancier bands are available — three different leather bands, a link bracelet or a Milanese loop. Prices go as high as $1,099 for a large watch with a stainless steel link bracelet. There are 20 official configurations, but once you factor in some leather bands coming in two or three sizes, you have 32 options to choose from. Edition is the luxury line with cases made of 18-karat gold alloy. It's $10,000 for a small version with the white or black band that comes with Sport models. The large one costs $12,000. You can get a leather band for $15,000 or $17,000, depending on the size. There are officially eight luxury configurations, or 12 if you count band sizes as choices. Apple is also selling bands separately for those who like to swap designs. Prices range from $49 for the basic sport band to $449 for a link bracelet. To help you choose, Apple has plenty of videos on its website and Apple Store and Apple Watch apps. The Apple Store app also has sizing guides, images of the watch cases in actual size and animation of buckles and clasps, which you can open and close by pinching in and out.",

Japanese women swear by the 'beauty from within' philosophy and prefer to sip on tincture tonics to beat acne - and the beauty movement is coming to the UK . Indeed, Mahonia, a traditional herbal treatment for acne, is a number one bestseller in the East Asian nation, reports Neal's Yard Remedies, who has seen sales of its Mahonia Clear Skin Formula go through the roof online from customers there. Mahonia, which is also known as Oregon Mountain Grape, is a berry native to the Rocky Mountains that's been used by tribes for medicinal, food, and ceremonial needs for years. It contains high levels of alkaloids, berberine and hydrastine, which are active compounds that give it antibacterial and anti-inflammatory  benefits. Thanks to these benefits, mahonia has been used traditionally for skin itchiness, infections and irritations, and is highly recommended for acne.

The antibacterial compounds in this herb are berbamine and berberine, which are antiseptic when used topically. When used internally, these compounds are liver tonics that improve bile flow, stimulate digestion and act as a tonic on the bowel wall. Neal's Yard Remedies created a tincture packed with the stuff, as well as a purifying blend of the skin-loving botanicals calendula, schisandra and gotu kola. Gotu kola helps stimulate collagen and tissue formation. It improves circulation, which benefits skin tone, and  has anti-inflammatory and skin-regenerating actions. When used internally, mahonia can improve bile flow, stimulate digestion and act as a tonic on the bowel wall . Antimicrobial herb calendula is rich in anti-ageing antioxidant beta-carotene, which is important for healthy skin structure and renewal. Also known as magnolia vine, schisandra has been used historically for immune support and for skin care. Modern Chinese research suggests it has a protective effect on the liver, so enhancing the cleansing benefits. The succulent globe artichoke, meanwhile, has been used in Chinese medicine for millennia as a digestive cleanser. It helps to purify and calm the system from within. It is recommended to add 2ml to a cupful of water three times a day to reap the rewards.",

    "source": "Fireman Stephen Hunt, 38, died after he and a colleague got into difficulties battling a fire started at Paul's Hair World in Manchester's Northern Quarter on July 13, 2013 . A 16-year-old girl charged with arson after she discarded a cigarette causing a city centre shop blaze which claimed the life of a firefighter had the charge dropped today after a judge said she was 'guilty only of being careless'. Fireman Stephen Hunt, 38, lost his life tackling the inferno which began at Paul's Hair World in Manchester's Northern Quarter almost two years ago. The girl - who was just 15 at the time - is said to have dropped a cigarette to the floor while standing near the shop's fire exit which rolled underneath the door and set boxes alight. She was originally charged with arson being reckless as to whether life was endangered, but was cleared having been due to stand trial on Monday. After more than a year of legal wrangling, with scientists initially stating that the fire could not have been started accidentally, further investigation led to the conclusion a discarded cigarette could have been the cause. More than 60 firefighters battled the blaze, which erupted on July 13, 2013, as frightened passers-by watched on. Father-of-two Mr Hunt, of Whitefield, Manchester, and another fireman, got into difficulties while tackling the fire and they were rushed to hospital where Mr Hunt was pronounced dead. At Manchester Crown Court, prosecutor Alexander Leach said thin and damaged cardboard boxes and paper labels stored behind the fire door at the business may well have caught fire if a cigarette was discarded. He said: 'Combined with the suggestion that boxes may have been on top of the smouldering cigarette, compressing and containing the heat, this made it more likely items would ignite. The salon was totally gutted when an inferno started by a discarded cigarette ripped through it. The 16-year-old girl who started the fire was today told she will not face trial for arson as she had only been 'careless' The family of Stephen Hunt visit the scene where he died. The girl who started the fire is said to have dropped a cigarette while standing near the shop's fire exit which rolled underneath the door and set boxes alight . Firefighters enter the remains of music venue NQ Live in Manchester which was also destroyed by the fire (left). Dozens of floral tributes to fireman Stephen Hunt were left at the scene (right) 'It was a hot day and there was a gap beneath the door and as a result experts were unable to exclude a chimney effect as air was drawn under the gap underneath the door and the fire began. 'The conclusion is the Crown's case, which had previously been based on scientific evidence which excluded accidental ignition, can no longer be sustained, so I offer no evidence.' The teenager, who did not attend court, was initially arrested along with another 15-year-old girl but she was the only one charged. Throwing the case out, Judge Michael Henshell said: 'I spent some time reading the papers and reports and it is perfectly obvious this terrible and tragic case demonstrates the danger and potential danger from discarded cigarettes. A fireman patrols the scene in Manchester's Northern Quarter where his colleague was killed. More than 1,000 firefighters, emergency service staff and members of the public lined the streets of Bury for Mr Hunt's funeral . More than 60 firefighters battled the blaze, which erupted on July 13, 2013, as passers-by watched on . 'This was discarded without any thought and as a result a fire started in circumstances which were particular to the site in question, resulting in extensive damage and costing the life of a man who, as part of his employment, was there to protect life and property. 'It was a terrible consequence for a thoughtless act. The girl who had been charged and faced trial was, in fact, blameless so far as criminal law is concerned and guilty only of being careless.' In September 2013 more than 1,000 firefighters, emergency service staff and members of the public lined the streets of Bury for Mr Hunt's funeral. In a tribute to him at his funeral, his son Sam said: 'To me, he wasn't just my dad but my hero, my role model and my best friend.' Following the hearing today, a spokesperson for Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said: 'We have made no comment on any aspect of the incident and are unlikely to do so until the coroner's inquest into Stephen's death has concluded. 'Safe to say we continue to work with everyone involved in various investigations to find the truth of what happened, not least for Stephen's family but for everyone involved and especially our firefighters.'",

Argentine striker Aguero opened the scoring after eight minutes at Old Trafford, and his controversial former City team-mate took the opportunity to lay into his biggest rivals from his time at the Etihad Stadium and at Anfield. Balotelli tweeted: 'Yeeeees city @aguerosergiokun !!! 1-0 OLD TRAFFORD...Stand up and shut up.' Mario Balotelli revealed his delight on Twitter after Manchester City scored early on in the Manchester derby . Balotelli tweeted: 'Yeeeees city @aguerosergiokun !!! 1-0 OLD TRAFFORD...Stand up and shut up.' Sergio Aguero struck after eight minutes to give City the lead but they were blitzed by United in a 4-2 loss . Despite Balotelli's gloating, the defeat for City is actually more beneficial to his Liverpool side . While United's blitz of City went on to leave the Italian red-faced anyway, the fact that a defeat for the champions was beneficial for his current club will not have gone unnoticed either. Instead, Balotelli seemed to throw his weight behind his former employers rather than clinging on to Liverpool's slim hopes of Champions League qualification that look like they will only open up if City's slump continues. Liverpool - and Balotelli - face Newcastle United on Monday night with the chance of closing the gap on City in fourth to four points in the Barclays Premier League. Controversial striker Balotelli listens in as Brendan Rodgers talks his team through a training session . Balotelli and his Liverpool team-mates face Newcastle United on Monday clinging to their top four hopes . And with Manuel Pellegrini's side having lost six of their last eight in all competitions the Anfield club maintain a small chance of taking a top four place, even if it isn't at the top of Balotelli's list of priorities. The 24-year-old has had his run-ins with the red half of Manchester before, famously celebrating a goal with his 'Why always me' shirt at Old Trafford in 2011 and clashing with Rio Ferdinand after a win over United at Wembley in the same year.",

Despite Liverpool needing Manchester City to lose for Champions League qualification hopes, their striker Balotelli appeared to support his former club City. Liverpool has an opportunity to narrow City's fourth-place advantage to four points when facing Newcastle United. • Balotelli has a contentious history with Manchester United, notably wearing a 'Why always me' shirt while scoring at Old Trafford (2011) and getting into an altercation with Rio Ferdinand at Wembley that same year",

The incident is difficult to comprehend as the collision was much more than just a minor skirmish on the tarmac at the busy Asian airport. The damage on the vehicle is clear, although it is unknown if the engine of the Boeing 777 jet was damaged or if anyone was injured. The bus ploughed into the engine of the Uzbekistan Airways Boeing 777 passenger jet . Tashkent is the largest international airport in Uzbekistan, and the busiest in Central Asia, so the crash will have more than likely delayed many passengers. The plane was believed to be an Uzbekistan Airways service, the national airline of the country, with its headquarters at Tashkent. MailOnline Travel has contacted Uzbekistan Airways and is awaiting comment. This kind of incident is unfortunately becoming more common. Ryanair passengers travelling to Edinburgh and Zadar, Croatia were delayed for hours after two of the budget airline’s planes clipped wings at Dublin Airport back on April 1. Photos snapped by travellers show the tip of a winglet dangling by a thread after clipping the other plane - and it's the second time in six months two Ryanair planes have collided at Ireland's busiest airport. It's difficult to comprehend the moments leading up the crash as the force of impact is severe . Passengers escaped injury when the planes collided as they taxied to a runway shortly before 8am, but the incident caused disruption for hundreds of travellers. In October 2014 a Ryanair jet had its winglet torn off when it collided with another plane belonging to the budget carrier at Dublin Airport. The Boeing 737s heading to Edinburgh and Brussels were taxiing to a runway when they collided in darkness. In January this year a British Airways plane hit a hangar at Heathrow Airport, while being towed away for routine maintenance. As the Boeing 777-200 aircraft was being towed towards a hangar, someone misjudged the distance and the plane's wing clipped the wall of a nearby building. There were no injuries from the collision, and the airport and airline continued to operate normally for the rest of the day.",

Hibs had secured a win over Hearts in the Edinburgh derby in the earlier kick-off and the Light Blues knew they had to respond. They bounced back from Thursday's defeat by Queen of the South, with Nicky Clark and Haris Vuckic claiming a goal apiece and Nicky Law grabbing a double. Nicky Clark celebrates after putting Rangers 1-0 up against Raith Rovers on Sunday . Clark in the air as he heads the ball towards goal to give the hosts the lead at Ibrox . Rangers manager Stuart McCall applauds the home fans after the full-time whistle . The win means Rangers and Hibs remain level on 61 points, albeit the Leith side have the better goal difference. Stuart McCall had suffered his first defeat as Rangers manager against Queens last week. So it was no real surprise to see him make three changes for the visit of Raith. Goalkeeper Cammy Bell was back between the sticks and Dean Shiels and Robbie Crawford were also added to the side. The Light Blues enjoyed the best possible start to the game when they surged into the lead after just six minutes. Clark found himself in plenty of space to connect with Law's corner and bullet a header home from 10 yards. Law then carved out a chance of his own but his shot from just inside the box was weak and easily held by Kevin Cuthbert. But the goalkeeper had no chance when Gers claimed their second of the day after 27 minutes. Vuckic cut inside from the right before unleashing a powerful drive into the bottom corner to claim his seventh Rangers goal. Haris Vuckic (left) fires the ball home to put Rangers 2-0 ahead against Raith Rovers . Vuckic (left) celebrates his Ibrox goal with team-mate Kenny Miller . Nicky Law slots it home to get the first of his two goals for Rangers on Sunday afternoon . Law (right) wheels away as he celebrates his goal for the home side . Raith could have pulled a goal back moments later but a well-struck free-kick from Ryan Conroy on the edge of the box was blocked by Bell. The visitors fired out another warning to Rangers shortly after the restart. Lewis Vaughan tried his luck with a snap-shot that fell inches past the upright as Raith tried to haul themselves back into the game. At the other end, the hosts passed up a decent chance to all but secure the three points. Vuckic released Crawford and he tried to tee up the shot for Law but he failed to connect in front of goal and the chance was lost. However Law was celebrating when he added his name to the scoresheet after 72 minutes, putting the game beyond Raith. Law's first attempt crashed off the crossbar but the ball fell kindly to his feet and he had the net bulging with the rebound from eight yards. Tom Walsh then saw a terrific volley saved well by the goalkeeper, before Law completed his double when he curled home from the edge of the box with two minutes to go. Law (left) strikes the ball towards goal as he scores Rangers' fourth goal of the afternoon . Law (left) is congratulated by his Rangers team-mates on his Sunday afternoon double .

    "source": "Margaret Gretton has been banned from classrooms for labelling an Asian job applicant 'Taliban' and calling special needs pupils 'roadkill' A primary school headteacher has been banned from classrooms for labelling an Asian job applicant 'Taliban' after referring to special needs pupils as 'roadkill'. Margaret Gretton, 46, has been barred indefinitely from the profession after she referred to the applicant as a member of the terror group and talked of 'bombs and blowing up the school' in an Asian accent. A disciplinary panel of the National College for Teaching and Leadership in Coventry ruled Ms Gretton 'exhibited clear intolerance on the grounds of race, as well as disability'. The panel said she showed no remorse for 'deliberate' and 'repeated' actions while head of Burton Joyce Primary School in Nottingham. They heard that she had mocked special needs students by referring to them as 'cuckoo' and said she didn't want to encourage children 'like that' to come to the school. She even displayed a Golly magnet in her office and made 'monkey noises' on one occasion when talking about black people. Her shocking behaviour continued over a 'sustained period of time' while she was headteacher of the school from September 2007 until November 2013. The panel concluded Ms Gretton 'displayed racist attitudes and behaviour in that - on one or more occasions you inappropriately commented in relation to a photograph of a male Asian job applicant.' It said her comments included 'would you hire me…I'm in the Taliban', or words to that effect, referring to the man as 'Mohammed', or words to that effect, and referring to 'bombs and blowing up the school', or words to that effect, in an Asian accent. A teacher at the school, named only as Staff Member E, told the panel that Ms Gretton said to her, unprompted: 'Do you like black men?' The teacher said she was 'taken aback' by the question, but added that it did not bother her, and her mother's partner was black and from Jamaica. She told the panel that Ms Gretton then 'burst out laughing and said words to the effect of 'does he have big lips?...does he look like a monkey?' and then went on to make monkey noises.' The headteacher denied making the comments, but the panel said it was 'satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the comments, or words similar to them, were made by Ms Gretton. ' The panel also found that she 'expressed inappropriate and discriminatory attitudes towards SEN [Special Educational Needs] pupils in the presence of school staff.' The panel said 'exhibited clear intolerance on the grounds of race, as well as disability' while head of Burton Joyce Primary School in Nottingham (pictured) They said she had used the word 'cuckoo' or words to that affect and said 'we don't want to encourage children like that to come here.' She was also found to have 'deliberately tried to upset' a special needs pupil, 'frightened him', and 'tried to make him cry.' Witness G gave evidence to the panel that on one occasion in 2010 a pupil would not come out from underneath a table and was disrupting the lesson so, as a teaching assistant, she asked Ms Gretton for assistance. She told the panel that 'Ms Gretton said 'It's like something from One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest' and said 'cuckoo, cuckoo' whilst twirling her finger at the side of her head.' A Special Education Needs co-ordinator, who also gave evidence to the panel, said that during a discussion in 2010 about creating a disabled parking space at the school car park she mentioned that Ms Gretton's parking space was the obvious place to put it. However she said that Ms Gretton said: 'We don't want to encourage people like that here.' Ms Gretton was also found to have bullied members of staff which the panel described as 'wholly unacceptable.' It concluded: 'The panel considered that Ms Gretton was not acting under duress, she lacked any insight into her behaviour and demonstrated no remorse. Her shocking behaviour continued over a 'sustained period of time' while she was headteacher of the school (pictured)  from September 2007 until November 2013 . 'Her actions towards staff and pupils were deliberate, repeated and over a sustained period of time. Ms Gretton seriously abused her position of power and trust within the school. ' After the panel made its recommendations Paul Heathcote, acting on behalf of the Secretary of State, decided to prohibit Ms Gretton from teaching indefinitely. He said: 'This is a case where the teacher has exhibited clear intolerance on the grounds of race, as well as disability.' He added: 'There has been no effort made by Ms Gretton to remedy the attitudinal deficiencies which have led her to behave in the way in which she did.' Describing his decision to prohibit the woman from teaching he said: ' This means that Ms Margaret Leandra Gretton is prohibited from teaching indefinitely and cannot teach in any school, sixth form college, relevant youth accommodation or children's home in England. 'Furthermore, in view of the seriousness of the allegations found proved against her, I have decided that Ms Margaret Leandra Gretton shall not be entitled to apply for restoration of her eligibility to teach.' Ms Gretton has right of appeal to the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court, until 28 days after she was given notice of the order.",

    "source": "From the dry, relentless heat of Alice Springs to the icy cold hills of Canberra, a university student will push his body to the limit, running a marathon in each of Australia’s eight states and territories to honour the memory of his late, treasured childhood friend. Although he had never run a marathon before, Callum Ryan, 21, committed himself to the daunting challenge of running eight of them between January and September 2015 - covering a total distance of 337.5 kilometres. His ‘Eight Great States’ campaign is driven by his passion to make a difference after the loss of his friend, Malachy Frawley who died from heart disease in 2013 when he was just 14 years old. Callum is preparing to battle vastly different weather conditions and diverse terrains as he pounds the pavement right around Australia, raising funds for not-for-profit organisation HeartKids Australia - supporting thousands of children living with heart defects. Callum posing like international running champion Usain Bolt at the finish line after the Canberra Times Marathon on April 12, with his little sister Josie and brother Henrik . Callum Ryan poses with his treasured friend Malachy Frawley, who sadly passed away when he was 14 . Malachy Frawley brought laughter to the world in his short but wonderful life, showing great courage through his lifelong battle with the severe heart condition Hypoplastic Right Heart Syndrome . The University of Sydney student has committed himself to the incredible endeavour in memory of a Malachy, who brought laughter to the world in his short but wonderful life, showing great courage through his lifelong battle with the severe heart condition Hypoplastic Right Heart Syndrome. Callum is inspired by the incredible strength and resilience Malachy displayed as he faced the challenges of a Congenital Heart Disease, which severely affected his mobility. Since January, Callum has already faced his first three marathons: kicking it all off with a 22 degree race in Hobart, sweating through the 28 degree heat in the Victoria town of Wangaratta and freezing through an icy seven degree start in Canberra. With each race, Callum has improved on his previous time by at least ten minutes. This comes despite his muscle fatigue with the quick turnaround as he pushes his body to recover and do it all again! The worst is yet to come, as Callum is scheduled to run a marathon in Darwin and then summon the strength to run another in Perth just 14 days later - and another 21 days after that in Sydney. Despite Malachy being five years Callum's junior, they forged a truly special friendship . 'Finished first! (out of all the people running to raise money for HeartKids obviously)' Callum joked after he finishing the Wangaratta marathon in sweltering, 35 degree heat . Eight Great States: One man, eight marathons, eight states and territories, nine months, 337.56 kilometres . Every step of the way, the memory of Malachy is never far from Callum's mind – helping him to find the mental strength to make it to the finish line. ‘At times during the race I thought “it’d be easier to stop now, no one would think any worse of you because a marathon is a tough thing to try”,' Callum said. ‘But I set out to do this. As I run, I sometimes think of Malachy and the thousands and thousands of other kids in that situation.' 'While I was running I thought about kids with Congenital Heart Disease and their families.' Callum is conscious of how lucky he is to be healthy and able to complete a marathon. Every step of the way, the memory of Malachy is never far from Callum's mind – helping him to find the mental strength to make it to the finish line . Malachy was the beloved younger brother of Niamh, Imogen and Seamus, growing up in NSW's Nowra . HeartKids made incredible changes to Malachy's life (pictured with his father Dom and mother Maggie). They supplied him with a segway so he could be more mobile and have his own independence . Hobart was the perfect location for Callum to embark on his first ever marathon - an ideal 22 degrees . ‘Children with CHD struggle to walk around in their day to day lives because their bodies aren't equipped. ‘I had to stick to my challenge because they find that strength every day.’ ‘I disappeared into those types of thoughts and the kilometres fell away.’ ‘With the personal connection none of it feels like a chore or a risk.’ He hopes to make people aware of the plight of children with heart disease and the need to support the children and their families. Every day in Australia, eight babies are born with a heart defect. Every week, four precious lives are lost and vital research needs to take place to work out of how to save them. ‘‘I first came across HeartKids through Malachy. I’d raised money for them before but I wanted to do something significant for Heartkids.’ Every day in Australia, eight babies are born with a heart defect. Every week, four precious lives are lost and vital research needs to take place to work out of how to save them . When Malachy (left) was in kindergarten the pair were excited to discover Callum (right) had also been allocated as Malachy’s Year Six buddy – a mentor and friendly face across the playground . Callum grew up in Nowra in New South Wales’ South Coast, where he formed a close bond with Malachy Frawley (second from left, with his siblings), a family friend five years his junior . ‘The most frightening thing about CHD is that there is no cure at the moment. If you’re born with it, then it’s with you for life. Lives are sadly cut short by it.’ Callum grew up in Nowra in New South Wales’ South Coast, where he formed a close bond with Malachy Frawley, a family friend five years his junior. When Malachy was in kindergarten the pair were excited to discover Callum had also been allocated as Malachy’s Year Six buddy – a mentor and friendly face across the playground. Despite Malachy being five years his junior, they forged a truly special friendship. ‘They had a very lovely friendship. They had the chance to get to know each other despite being five years apart,’ explained Malachy’s father, Dr Dom Frawley. ‘Lucky enough for Callum and Malachy they were paired up and their personalities really gelled. Although he had never run a marathon before, Callum Ryan, 21, committed himself to the daunting challenge of running eight of them between January and September 2015 . Since January, Callum has already faced his first three marathons: including sweating through the 28 degree heat in the Victoria town of Wangaratta (r) and freezing through a seven degree start in Canberra (l) ‘Malachy looked up to Callum a lot as a mentor and Callum took that role seriously and invested a lot of time in Malachy. ‘They got the chance to discover they had a lot in common in the way they saw and thought about things, particularly in the way they were so creative.’ In his fourteen short years, Malachy left his mark on the world – creating, daydreaming and making people smile. Malachy has been remembered as ‘an author, film director, comedian, drummer, raconteur and HeartKids.’ He was adored for his ‘wit and loving nature.’ Malachy was affected by one of the most serious heart conditions, which greatly affected his mobility. Although Callum will be travelling to many marathons alone during his Eight States campaign, he travelled via Camry with his great mate Nick Peters to his third marathon in the ACT . Dom and his family have been greatly touched by Callum’s (third from left) commitment to making a change in the life of other children . He had needed to rely on others to drive or piggyback up from place to place, until HeartKids gifted him with a Segway. ‘The Segway completely transformed his life,’ said his father Dom. ‘He could suddenly get places without having to rely on people to carry him, which was quite a dramatic change from what he’d always been able to do.’ Their boy with a quick wit and limitless imagination now had the freedom of movement and increased independence, able to travel around his neighbourhood and to and from school. ‘I left the training a bit late before my first marathon, frankly. I felt really nervous before my first marathon, thinking “have I done enough?”’. Dom and his family have been greatly touched by Callum’s commitment to making a change in the life of other children. ‘We’re very gratified and we’re touched by it. Hopefully it will help a lot of people with the sickness to raise funds and awareness. ‘It’s great for him to have that awareness. Callum cares a lot about people.’ You can donate to Callum's Eight Great States campaign to help HeartKids here .

    "source": "STYLE OVER SUBSTANCE . This game is being billed as Beauty v the Beast, but don’t underestimate Arsene Wenger. It’s not just about style — he plays to win. The philosophy Wenger has imposed has made Arsenal popular throughout the world. People love to watch them, certainly more than Jose Mourinho’s teams. But on Sunday, he is up against the ultimate pragmatist — Mourinho finds any way to win. Chelsea have conceded just two goals in their last six clashes with Arsenal, keeping four clean sheets in the process. Mourinho does exactly what’s necessary. So while Wenger always aims to win, he still cares about the brand of football played. Mourinho’s brand is winning. Arsene Wenger (left) pushed Jose Mourinho when Chelsea beat Arsenal 6-0 at Stamford Bridge last season . Wenger can not be underestimated, according to Martin Keown... it's not all about style, he plays to win . TALKING TACTICS . Arsenal should dominate possession while Chelsea are more likely to sit deep and use the electric pace of Eden Hazard and Willian on the break. Chelsea will be very disciplined and in some ways that is a shame because the players aren’t allowed to express themselves as they might. In the reverse fixture in October, Chelsea pressed Arsenal all over and Wenger’s side were stifled — they did not get a shot on target for the first time in a Premier League match since 2003. Jose creates such an intensity and focus that winning becomes a matter of life and death. But Arsenal will send waves of players forward at pace and try to isolate Branislav Ivanovic, Gary Cahill and John Terry, who are not the quickest. Keown (right) and Wenger go back a long way, after Keown's two stints at Arsenal during his career . Chelsea boss Mourinho always finds a way to win and has a brilliant record against Wenger . CHANGE THE RECORD . Mourinho's record over Wenger is remarkable. Not many managers can say they have never lost to Arsene Wenger. Jose feels he knows Wenger’s game and the Arsenal boss can’t surprise him. I’d be amazed if Chelsea go all out to attack, but they will still pack a punch on the break. FLAVOUR OF THE MONTH . Jose wants to win every trophy going but he has a poor record in the Premier League Manager of the Month award. He has only won it three times, the same as Alan Curbishley and one fewer than Joe Kinnear. Wenger has won it 14 times. THE CESC DIFFERENCE . Cesc Fabregas has enjoyed a brilliant season at Chelsea but I don’t think he would have necessarily benefited Arsenal had he joined. That central midfield area is very congested and he would have halted Aaron Ramsey’s progress. But one thing is certain on Sunday — he won’t receive a warm welcome. Mourinho has a poor Premier League Manager of the Month record; he has won as many as Alan Curbishley . Cesc Fabregas has been impressive this season, but he wouldn't necessarily have been as good with Arsenal .",

    "source": "For those who like their plot lines thick and brimming with intrigue, steering clear of Paisley last night seemed the judicious option. A Celtic side with the scent of the Treble in their nostrils facing a St Mirren outfit badly in danger of entering free-fall scarcely looked like a recipe for a Friday-night thriller. And yet, for all Ronny Deila’s side prevailed in the end, this scrap provided compelling evidence that they won’t simply be given a free ride towards a fourth successive title in the coming weeks. Celtic winger Kris Commons (right) has a shot on goal during the SPL match against St Mirren on Friday . St Mirren's Jim Goodwin slides in with a challenge on Celtic midfielder Stefan Johansen at St Mirren Park . St Mirren (4-4-2): Ridgers, Naismith, McAusland, Genev, Tesselaar, Goodwin, Dayton (Thompson 78), Mallan (Sonupe 77), McGinn, Sadlier (Morgan 73), Arquin . Subs not used: Kelly, Gow, Reilly, Wilks . Booked: Goodwin, Genev . Celtic (4-4-2): Gordon, Matthews (Ambrose Emuobo 65), Van Dijk, Denayer, Izaguirre, Brown, Johansen, Forrest, Commons (Mackay-Steven 72), Armstrong (Bitton 66), Stokes . Subs not used: Guidetti, Zaluska, Griffiths, McGregor . Scorers: Forrest 64 . Referee: Alan Muir . St Mirren may be at the bottom of the Premiership table and still four points from even a play-off spot but, on this showing, they aren’t out of it yet. They frustrated Celtic for the most part here, their energy and belief taking them so far — but not far enough. James Forrest was the man whose intervention broke Gary Teale’s heart with a second half tap-in while any realistic chance of an unlikely comeback was killed off when Stefan Johansen later converted from the penalty spot. Now eight points clear of Aberdeen, however, Deila’s misgivings about a far from perfect display will be tempered with a realisation that the title is edging ever closer to his grasp. The Celtic boss made four changes from the side which won the last of the four game-series with Dundee United before the international break. St Mirren goalkeeper Mark Ridgers (centre) comes out to punch the ball clear of the head of Jason Denayer . Commons (right) and Ste Mirren's John McGinn (left) tussle for the ball during the SPL match on Friday . St Mirren's Jason Naismtih (right) battles with Stuart Armstrong (left) during the SPL match in Paisley . Out went Efe Ambrose, Nir Bitton, Gary Mackay-Steven and John Guidetti with Adam Matthews, Anthony Stokes, Kris Commons and Forrest the beneficiaries. Surprisingly, given the poverty of his side’s display in the defeat to St Johnstone, Teale made only three alterations with Kieran Sadlier, Marc McAusland and Yoann Arquin restored to the side. St Mirren’s attempts to address the obvious quality gap with guts and industry bore early fruit. With next to no time on the ball, Celtic were unable to find their rhythm let alone a killer pass. Commons, typically, was the man who found the space others couldn’t in order to fashion the first chance. Dropping into a pocket of space behind the Saints defence, he gathered Scott Brown’s incisive pass then shaped as if to cross. His attempt to beat Mark Ridgers at his near post was audacious but unsuccessful as the goalkeeper turned the ball around the post. Now playing without the burden of international football, Commons looked better for the break. When Johansen picked him out 30 yards from goal, he glided away from three challenges before lashing a shot into the side-netting. Largely written off as relegation certainties after their last dire outing in Perth, no one could accuse St Mirren of not giving it their all as they sought to claim an unlikely bonus point to help their plight. Celtic's James Forrest (left) tussles for the ball with St Mirren's Jeroen Tesselaar (right) on Friday night . St Mirren' s Yoann Arquin (left) has a shot at goal but it is saved by Celtic goalkeeper Craig Gordon (centre) Celtic really ought to have taken the lead in 26 minutes. Stuart Armstrong had started the game with a couple of heavy touches but his pass to Commons was perfectly weighted. Commons took one touch to control and a second to blast the ball towards Ridgers’ goal. The keeper blocked smartly, though. St Mirren then finally worried Craig Gordon. Sadlier danced away from Matthews on the flank and found the space between Celtic’s central defenders where Stephen Mallan was lurking. His header floated towards the keeper’s top corner but never with the required velocity to beat him. Ridgers was earning his corn. When Commons turned provider for Forrest, the winger looked to have picked his spot in the bottom corner with a side-foot only for the keeper’s agility to leave the Celtic star with his head buried in his hands. It served to embolden the home side. Armstrong’s tackle on Sadlier inadvertently set up Arquin but the striker seemed spooked by the chance and fired weakly into Gordon’s arms. Deila isn’t renowned for endangering crockery collections at half-time in dressing rooms up and down the land but it can safely be assumed he had a few choice words for a Celtic side that been some way short of sparkling in the first period. Celtic manager Rory Deila (left) gives instructions to his captain Scott Brown (right) against St Mirren . Forrest slides on his knees to celebrate scoring Celtic's opening goal against St Mirren on Friday night . Armstrong’s dipping shot from 20 yards was a yard shy of changing the narrative of the night within 60 seconds of the restart before Stokes’ snap-shot was easily claimed by Ridgers. When Jeroen Tesselaar needlessly conceded a corner, he was grateful to the goalkeeper for punching Jason Denayer’s header off his line. Commons smashed the spoils low into the side-net. Mallan issued a timely reminder that St Mirren were still very much in the game with a strike that had Gordon scrambling. The Saints midfielder sprawled to the turf after a foot sprint with Brown on the counter-attack but ref Alan Muir wasn’t interested. Just as the Buddies looked to have the measure of the league leaders — so much so that Deila was looking to his bench — one moment of slackness cost them dear. Brown was the catalyst with a supreme pass in behind Tesselaar, taking the Dutchman out of the game and holding up perfectly for Matthews. Celtic midfielder Johansen slots home from the penalty spot to secure his side's 2-0 victory at St Mirren . The Welshman’s low cross was accurate and turned home with a flash of Forrest’s boot at the far post — his second goal in three games. With that, Matthews and Armstrong departed to be replaced by Bitton and Ambrose before Mackay-Steven came on for Commons. Saints, to their huge credit, stuck to their task with Jim Goodwin, who had been harshly booked in the first half, seemingly at the heart of everything. Some 11 minutes from time, the result was put beyond all reasonable doubt. Forrest’s shot did strike Viktor Genev on the arm but there seemed a case to be made in mitigation that it was not deliberate. The Bulgarian was booked for squabbling with Muir’s decision but the delay didn’t perturb Johansen who calmly sent Ridgers the wrong way from 12 yards.",

The \"number of children running for their lives within Nigeria, or crossing over the border to Chad, Niger and Cameroon, has more than doubled in just less than a year.\" UNICEF released a report on the crisis titled \"Missing Childhoods.\" It also launched a social media campaign using the hashtag #bringbackourchildhood. The campaign has \"leading Snapchat artists\" sharing images based on drawings from children in Nigeria, Chad, Niger and Cameroon.  Artwork can also be seen on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr. More than 1.5 million people have fled their homes due to the violence, UNICEF said. About 1.2 million are displaced internally, while others have crossed into Cameroon, Chad and Niger. \"The vast majority of the displaced -- more than 880,000 -- are staying with host communities with little access to humanitarian support, putting additional strains on already stretched health, education and social services,\" it said. The April 14, 2014, kidnappings at a girls school in Chibok by the Islamist group Boko Haram \"is only one of endless tragedies being replicated on an epic scale across Nigeria and the region,\" said Manuel Fontaine, UNICEF regional director for West and Central Africa. \"Scores of girls and boys have gone missing in Nigeria -- abducted, recruited by armed groups, attacked, used as weapons, or forced to flee violence.

    "source": "Turkey has blocked access to Twitter and YouTube after they refused a request to remove pictures of a prosecutor held during an armed siege last week. A Turkish court imposed the blocks because images of the deadly siege were being shared on social media and 'deeply upset' the wife and children of Mehmet Selim Kiraz, the hostage who was killed. The 46-year-old Turkish prosecutor died in hospital when members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front (DHKP-C) stormed a courthouse and took him hostage. The DHKP-C is considered a terrorist group by Turkey, the European Union and US. Scroll down for video . A Turkish court has blocked access to Twitter and YouTube after they refused a request to remove pictures of prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz held during an armed siege last week . Grief: The family of Mehmet Selim Kiraz grieve over his coffin during his funeral at Eyup Sultan Mosque in Istanbul, Turkey. He died in hospital after he was taken hostage by the far-left organisation . Two of his captors were killed when security forces took back the building where the far-left group was holding him. Gunshots were heard and smoke could be seen rising from the scene at the end of the six-hour stand-off. Mr Kiraz, a father-of-two married to a judge who also worked at the courthouse, was targeted for his part in an investigation into the death of Berkin Elvan. The 15-year-old was severely wounded after being hit on the head by a tear-gas canister fired by a police officer during anti-government protests in Istanbul in June 2013. After spending 269 days in a coma, Elvan eventually died on March 11 last year. His death, and the subsequent investigation, have since become a rallying point for the country's far-left. Gathering: Prosecutors, lawyers and judges stand near a statue of Lady Justice during the funeral ceremony . A British national, of Polish origin but who has not been named, was arrested on Saturday as part of an operation against the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front, according to reports. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said this morning: 'I can confirm that a British national has been arrested in Turkey and that we are offering consular assistance.' Before imposing the blocks on the websites, Turkish authorities had tried to prevent newspapers printing images taken during the siege last week. The newspapers were accused by the government of 'spreading terrorist propaganda' in sharing the images of the hostage-taking. Presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said: 'This has to do with the publishing of the prosecutor's . picture. What happened in the aftermath (of the prosecutor's . killing) is as grim as the incident itself. 'The demand from the prosecutor's office is that this image . not be used anywhere in electronic platforms. 'The wife and children of prosecutor Kiraz have been deeply . upset. The images are everywhere.' He added: 'A request has been made to both Twitter and YouTube for the . removal of the images and posts but they have not accepted it . and no response has been given. 'That's why . this decision has been taken through a court in Istanbul.' Critical: Prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz was taken to hospital with gunshot wounds but died of his injuries . Strength of feeling: Elvan has since become an icon for the Turkish far-left and his supporters accuse the authorities of covering up the circumstances and perpetrators of his death . Google said it was working to restore service to the YouTube . video-sharing site, which it owns. Twitter also said it was . working to restore access for its users. Facebook said it had complied with a Turkish court order requiring it to restrict access to some content or face a block on its service. A company spokesman said it would appeal the order. Turkey's telecoms regulator could not immediately be reached . and there was no statement on its website. This is not the first time that Turkish authorities have imposed blocks on social media sites and networks. In the run-up to local elections in March 2014 blocks were imposed after recordings circulated allegedly revealing corruption among senior officials. Figures provided by Twitter revealed that Turkey filed more requests to remove content from the social network than any other nation between July and December 2014.",

    "source": "Patients tried and failed to book almost 34 million GP appointments last year, shocking new figures have revealed. A study reported in the British Medical Journal found that 90 per cent of patients were able to get an appointment in 2013/14. The 10 per cent who could not amounts to around 33.8 million unsuccessful attempts each year - or 81 per surgery each week. The shambolic situation is responsible for as many as a quarter of A&E visits, the researchers say. Lack of access: Patients tried and failed to book almost 34 million GP appointments last year . The figures, from the GP Patient Survey, also show that patients who report worse access to conventional GP appointments are more likely to use out-of-hours   services. And surgeries where patients were able to see a GP within two week days had lower rates of A&E department visits. Other research has suggested that greater access to GP surgeries is linked with lower rates of emergency admissions for conditions such as heart failure and stroke. The figures come just a day after it was revealed one in five visits to A&E are unnecessary. A fifth of patients turning up in A&E have self-treatable conditions including sore throats, athlete’s foot and head lice, a study has claimed. Researchers have calculated that more than 4 million visits a year are unnecessary – costing the NHS £290 million. Doctors have even reported patients showing up because they were hungover, their false nails were hurting or they had paint in their hair. The analysis of data from 15 A&E units by consultancy firm IMS Health found that 19 per cent of patients had what is called a ‘self-treatable condition’. The data covered one in ten A&E units across England, so if the trends are mirrored across the country, then an estimated 4.1million of the 21.7million visits last year were for minor ailments. The problem is largely caused by the fact that patients find it difficult to see a GP, particularly out of hours. Many go to A&E in the knowledge that they will at least be seen by a doctor that day, even if they have to wait four hours. Today's piece, written by academics from Imperial College London and New York University, points out that more GPs are required if access is to be improved. But they add politicians' promises of an extra 5,000 to 8,000 GPs are likely to be challenging to achieve. Effect: The situation is responsible for as many as a quarter of A&E visits, the researchers say. The new figures come just a day after it was revealed a fifth of patients turning up to casualty have self-treatable conditions including sore throats, athlete’s foot and head lice . So despite election pledges by the Tories and Labour to improve access to GPs appointments, they argue these promises are unlikely to be achieved within a parliamentary term. The 'public should [therefore] question the promises of politicians', they said. The BMJ report said largest increase in GPs over a previous parliamentary term in the past 20 years was 5,414 GPs (from 2004/05 to 2008/09) under Labour. But Labour's previous pledge for all appointments within 48 hours was 'far from being achieved', it adds. Only 81 per cent of patients ended up able to see a GP within two weekdays in 2009/10 when the party was last in government. The researchers add there is also no firm proof that more patients getting to see their doctor will lead to fewer A&E attendances. David Cameron has promised patients will be able to access GP surgeries between 8am and 8pm seven days a week by 2020 if the Tories are re-elected. Ed Miliband has guaranteed appointments within 48 hours if Labour are voted in. But the piece said these pledges may prove unrealistic, adding that the evidence behind them has not been made clear - and the problem with access has not been precisely defined. Denial: The study authors say that despite election pledges by the Tories and Labour (David Cameron and Ed Miliband are pictured, left to right) to improve access to GPs appointments, these promises are unlikely to be achieved within a parliamentary term . 'The aims and rationale of the policies outlined by the Conservative and Labour parties do not seem explicit,' the analysis said. 'One aim is undoubtedly to win election votes. But the aims for the NHS and for patients are less clear.' The analysis suggests five points of action 'for policy and research if improvements in access are pursued'. These are: . * Evaluating the extended opening hours pilot scheme carried out by the Tories . * Making general practice consultation data routinely available . * Looking at employing practice staff besides GPs . * Evaluating new types of appointment such as telephone consultations . * Considering alternatives to general practice such as pharmacist-led minor illness services. Lead author Thomas Cowling, of Imperial College London, said: 'Both parties have made bold promises about access to GP services, but the evidence behind their pledges is lacking. 'It's important that policies like extended access are independently evaluated before being implemented more widely. 'The pledges on increases to the GP workforce are very ambitious and unlikely to be met within a parliamentary term.' Instead, he recommended the NHS evaluates the use of new types of appointment that have been proposed to increase GP capacity, such as consultations and triage by phone or online. 'It should also consider other types of staff who could take on some of the work of GPs.'",

    "source": "Former Leeds and England coach Tony Smith admits he was shocked by Kevin Sinfield's decision to switch codes but, on reflection, believes it could be an inspired decision. Sinfield, 34, the greatest captain in Leeds' history, stunned the world of rugby league with his sudden announcement that he will quit the sport at the end of the season and join the Rhinos' sister club Yorkshire Carnegie on an 18-month contract. Sinfield, who is closing in on third place in rugby league's all-time scoring list with 3,997 points, told a news conference at Headingley he did not want to play against Rhinos and that the opportunity to spearhead Carnegie's bid for a Premiership return was too good to resist. Leeds Rhinos captain Kevin Sinfield is to switch codes and join Yorkshire Carnegie at the end of the season . Sinfield (centre) lifts the Super League trophy after Leeds beat Warrington in the grand final in October 2012 . Warrington coach Tony Smith (left) speaks with fellow coaches Tony Rea and Brian McDermott . Smith, who was in charge of the Rhinos when Sinfield lifted the first of their six Super League titles in 2003, says he is sad to see his former skipper swap codes. 'I was a bit shocked,' Smith said. 'It took me a couple of minutes to think about it. He's a champion player, he's been a champion player for his club and his country for many years. 'I'm sad to lose him to that other code. However, I could understand the rationale. If it's a way of him plying his trade for longer - his trade of playing rugby and being a terrific professional - I can see why he's made that change. 'I think he'll have a lot to still contribute to their sport and to that club. It's not a huge switch for him in terms of training venues. 'He'll still have his bumps and bruises, but the fact that he can continue to do that and probably get well rewarded for it, I can't blame him.' Sinfield, whose bombshell announcement came just four days after his predecessor as England captain Jamie Peacock revealed he would be leaving Leeds at the end of the season to become football manager at Hull KR, has missed Leeds' last two games through injury and, according to Smith, is probably stepping down at the right time. Sinfield (left) in action for England against France during the 2013 Rugby League World Cup quarter-final . Sinfield is tackled during a match between Leeds Rhinos and Leigh Centurions last year . 'I think it's fantastic to make that decision to bow out of Super League probably at the right time,' Smith added. 'You can't keep playing forever and, when those young guys come snapping at your heels, it's hard to keep them at bay at some stage. 'You have to bite the bullet and step aside and I'd say the time is probably right. I'm no expert on when other people should retire but I'm pleased for Kevin and he'll certainly give everything he's got to his new employers. 'That's how he's been in rugby league and I've got no reason to think it'll be any different.' Sinfield has never played rugby union but already identified a role for himself in his new sport as he follows in the footsteps of Jason Robinson, Andy Farrell and Sam Burgess. 'Ideally I'd like to play fly-half,' Sinfield said. 'It's the position that suits the skill set I have the best. Sinfield and his Leeds team-mates celebrate after beating Melbourne Storm in the 2008 World Club Challenge . 'I understand the challenge that's in front of me and the difficulties rugby league players have faced crossing over. That's why I think I'm in the best possible place to help with that transition. 'Playing union is something I've always wanted to do. I didn't want to end my career and have regrets about missed opportunities. When this opportunity came up I knew it was the right thing. 'I'm excited by it. I know the potential at the club and it's something I'd like to be a part of. 'I'm very respectful of the game and I like watching it. I think a lot of rugby league people look down on rugby union, and I think a lot of rugby union people look down on rugby league. But I like both games. As a sportsman, to get the opportunity to play another professional sport is something that really appeals to me.'",

    "source": "Jason Orange shocked Take That fans around the world when he quit the chart-topping band last September but he hasn't said goodbye to them forever. Busy man: Gary Barlow is preparing for his musical Finding Neverland to open and the new Take That tour to begin . For as the remaining members Gary Barlow, Mark Owen and Howard Donald prepare to hit the road as a trio on their new tour - opening in Glasgow on April 27 - Gary has revealed to MailOnline that Jason will be proudly cheering on his former bandmates. Speaking exclusively to MailOnline ahead of the premiere of his new Broadway musical Finding Neverland on Wednesday, Gary said: 'He wants to come to the shows, he'll definitely be there. I don't think we'll be able to get him up on stage but he'll be there.' Regarding Jason's departure, Gary added: 'I think we've gotten used to it. It was very strange to start with it but it's been over six months. 'We're just so excited to hit the road. People come to a Take That show expecting an extravaganza and that's exactly what they're going to get.' However, before Gary can get back to the UK for tour rehearsals, he has the small matter of seeing his musical open on Broadway. And as he waited for the premiere to take place in New York on Wednesday, Gary admitted he was feeling equal parts nervous and excited. He said: 'It's felt like a little secret for so long and it felt like it was never ever going to happen. It feels quite weird to hand over our little baby and have everyone see it.' It was the new Late Late Show host James Corden who first put Gary in touch with Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein when he was looking for someone to write the score for his musical Finding Neverland. He'll be back: Gary told MailOnline that Jason (second left) is excited to come and see his former bandmates on their new tour . Speaking of James, Gary said: I feel like I'm going to owe him for the rest of my life and he's loving that at the moment. He's doing brilliant on The Late Late Show and if he'd have us we'd definitely go on and perform some songs from the musical.' Speaking about Hollywood supremo Harvey, Gary admitted he was surprised by how much creative control Weinstein gave him and co-writer Eliot Kennedy. 'He's someone that I'd heard about and I was really keen to meet him,' Gary told MailOnline. When he called me up I was definitely interested. 'I didn't know how he worked but now I realise he is a creative. He completely trusted our music. We've had an amazing couple of years.' And then there were three: Gary promised fans that they can expect an 'extravaganza' when they come to see the new tour . It's not goodbye: Jason Orange shocked Take That fans around the world when he quit the chart-topping band last September but he hasn't said goodbye to them forever . While Gary had a taste of Hollywood when he performed songs from Finding Neverland at Harvey's pre-Oscars party, he insisted he will be sticking to writing and not asking Harvey to cast him in a new project. 'The last time I acted was on Heartbeat in 1998,' Gary said. 'Diane, the director of Neverland, always calls me JM Gary and says she is going to get me up on stage. 'I cannot act whatsoever, so I think I'm just going to stick to writing and singing.' 'He completely trusted our music': Gary revealed Hollywood mogul and Finding Neverland producer Harvey Weinstein has been extremely encouraging since bringing him on to write the music for the Broadway musical . Big night: On Wednesday Gary's Finding Neverland had its Broadway premiere . That's what friends are for: It was the new Late Late Show host James Corden who first put Gary in touch with Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein when he was looking for someone to write the score for his musical . Meanwhile, Gary admitted he is dismayed by Louis Walsh's recent declaration that his X Factor days could be numbered and said he hopes the veteran judge doesn't leave. Barlow exclusively told MailOnline: 'I really hope he doesn't leave. To me he's the life of that show. He brings the silliness to it and that's what everyone loves. He's a big part of it behind the scenes too. I don't think they should lose him. I think what could happen is he might leave and then they'll get to auditions and send a plane for him.' Stronger than ever: Gary believes that Zayn Malik's (second left) departure from One Direction won't stop the band going on to even greater success . Just as Jason Orange's departure from Take That shocked fans, so too did Zayn Malik's recent decision to quit One Direction. But Gary believes the remaining members Niall Horan, Harry Styles, Liam Payne and Louis Tomlinson will come out it stronger than ever. Gary, who also saw Robbie Williams leave Take That in 1995, said: 'I think it's slightly easier for the band. You can lean on each other. I think it's always harder for the one who leaves. 'For One Direction it's just a transitional period. Like us their fans are very supportive.' Finding Neverland, directed by Diane Paulus, explores the Peter Pan book's back story and stars Matthew Morrison of Glee and former Frasier star Kelsey Grammer. Performances begin March 15 at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre. Former co-star: Gary admitted he is dismayed by Louis Walsh's recent declaration that his X Factor days could be numbered and said he hopes the veteran judge doesn't leave .",

'He completely trusted our music': Gary revealed Hollywood mogul and Finding Neverland producer Harvey Weinstein has been extremely encouraging since bringing him on to write the music for the Broadway musical . Big night: On Wednesday Gary's Finding Neverland had its Broadway premiere . That's what friends are for: It was the new Late Late Show host James Corden who first put Gary in touch with Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein when he was looking for someone to write the score for his musical . Meanwhile, Gary admitted he is dismayed by Louis Walsh's recent declaration that his X Factor days could be numbered and said he hopes the veteran judge doesn't leave. Barlow exclusively told MailOnline: 'I really hope he doesn't leave. To me he's the life of that show. He brings the silliness to it and that's what everyone loves. He's a big part of it behind the scenes too. I don't think they should lose him. I think what could happen is he might leave and then they'll get to auditions and send a plane for him.' Stronger than ever: Gary believes that Zayn Malik's (second left) departure from One Direction won't stop the band going on to even greater success . Just as Jason Orange's departure from Take That shocked fans, so too did Zayn Malik's recent decision to quit One Direction. But Gary believes the remaining members Niall Horan, Harry Styles, Liam Payne and Louis Tomlinson will come out it stronger than ever. Gary, who also saw Robbie Williams leave Take That in 1995, said: 'I think it's slightly easier for the band. You can lean on each other. I think it's always harder for the one who leaves. 'For One Direction it's just a transitional period. Like us their fans are very supportive.' Finding Neverland, directed by Diane Paulus, explores the Peter Pan book's back story and stars Matthew Morrison of Glee and former Frasier star Kelsey Grammer. Performances begin March 15 at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre. Former co-star: Gary admitted he is dismayed by Louis Walsh's recent declaration that his X Factor days could be numbered and said he hopes the veteran judge doesn't leave .",

Police launched an investigation after seizing a package on April 9 with over a kilo of the date rape drug GBL addressed to  Fred Pagan, office manager and personal assistant to Sen. Thad Cochran (R-MS). Raiding his home on Thursday, they uncovered 181.5 grams of meth. Senator: Thad Cochran (R-MS) has yet to comment on the fact that his personal assistant and office manager Fred Pagan has been charged with trafficking drugs, including methamphetamine, from China . Pagan was paid $160,000 in his Senate role last year, the Washington Post reports. The paper states Pagan, 49, has worked for Cochran since he was 16 years old. He is charged with one count of possession and intent to distribute methamphetamine and one count of importing a controlled substance. The former is punishable by five to 40 years in prison, the latter by up to 20. Pagan was released on Friday after an initial court appearance. He will appear again on May 14. Court documents read by The Washington City Paper say Pagan admits he acquired three loads of drugs through a dealer. He is accused of buying the substances to exchange for sexual favors. Sen Cochran's spokesman Chris Gallegos confirmed a staff member had been arrested but refused to confirm further details. He told the City Paper: 'Our office is in the process of consulting with Senate legal counsel.' GBL, the drug Cochran allegedly acquired from a dealer in China, is similar to the date rape drug GHB. It is illegal to manufacture or sell either variant of the drug in the United States. Users can face two years in prison, suppliers up to 14 years. The drug, which is in liquid form, is packaged is select types of plastic as it is said to burn through many normal types of packaging.",

    "source": "A man has made the infamous shepherds pie-trifle combination of custard, jam and meat immortalised in popular TV show Friends. On the show hapless character Rachel decided to treat her loved ones to what she mistakenly thought was 'a traditional English trifle' layered with all the trimmings - including ladyfingers, jam, custard, beef sautéed with peas and onions, a little more custard, bananas and some whipped cream. Now one brave Mancunian has whipped up their own version of the unusual concoction - replacing the beef with the far more traditional lamb. Scroll down for video . Neil Killham made the infamous shepherds pie-trifle combination immortalised on Friends 16 years ago. It features sponge, jam, custard, lamb, peas, onions, whipped cream and is garnished with sprinkles . Neil Killham, a 32-year-old software engineer from Manchester, announced his plans on Twitter with a picture of his clashing ingredients with the caption: 'It's finally time. I'm making The Trifle Out Of Friends.' Giving a running commentary on the social media site, Neil proudly showed off the finished masterpiece which actually looked very respectable - until he cut into it. He told his followers that while it does not taste like feet - as characters on the show claimed - it was still 'f****** horrible'. He added: 'But with enough nice trifle stuff that we keeping eating more of it.' The trifle-shepherds pie combination did not look quite as appetising once it had been sliced into . Friends character Rachel Green (played by Jennifer Aniston) accidentally made the disgusting dessert . Neil posted this picture of a friend attempting a second go at the trifle pie - it doesn't appear to have improved . 'I thought I'd be able to compartmentalise the clashing flavours, but I cannot.' When MailOnline asked how it tasted, Neil, who shared the dish with friends, said: 'It tasted terrible of course - but not so bad that I couldn't finish my slice. 'It's the way you sometimes think you've got lucky and got a nice pure trifle bite and then pow! Lamb!' He said in the last year he has made curry flavoured cupcakes, a chilli cheesecake and a pancake pizza, among other things. 'Usually they kind of work, so I figured it was time to try something that definitely wouldn't,' he said. 'Although when I tried sprouts in marmite that didn't work either, but it wasn't as bad as this. 'A couple of people tried it with me last night and agreed it was terrible. Opinions were mixed on whether the lamb or the onion was the biggest problem. 'Then a couple of people at work also tried it and came to similar conclusions. 'Except for one guy who said \"it wasn't that bad really. Not good, but not the worst\". 'I'm not sure I can trust him any more.' The trifle looked distinctly unappetising when dished up on a plate - and apparently tasted even worse . In the show the dessert was described as half trifle, half shepherd's pie after two pages in the English cookery book Rachel was using stuck together - but the creators mistakenly used beef instead of the lamb which is traditional in the pie. Towards the end of the season six episode the penny finally drops and Rachel says: 'I wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle!' If for some reason you would like to recreate this Heston Blumenthal-esque clash of flavours and textures, the recipe would appear to be: A layer of sponge, layer of jam, layer of custard, layer of raspberries, another layer of sponge, layer of lamb sautéed with peas and onions, a bit more custard, banana, and a topping of whipped cream garnished with hundreds and thousands .",

The 28-year-old (right) recently signed a new long-term deal at Zenit until the end of the 2018-19 season . Hulk, who has 41 caps for Brazil, recently signed a new long-term deal at the Russian club until the end of the 2018-19 season.

The club did not provide any financial details of the new contract - with the striker having netted 15 goals in 33 appearances for the Russian giants in all competitions at present.

    "source": "Many couples disagree over what to name their children — but one New York couple’s battle over their unborn baby’s moniker became so unbearable that they have asked random members of the public to help them reach a decision. Kseniya Soukeras, who is due in August, wants to name her unborn child Michael, after her late father. Her husband Nicholas prefers the Greek name Spyridon, after his own father. Because they have been unable to settle their disagreement privately, the couple has turned to the general public to help them make a decision; Nicholas, 37, has launched an online petition asking for help to sway his wife. Baby name showdown: Nicholas and Kseniya Soukeras can't agree over whether to name their child Spyridon or Michael, which Nicholas says his wife will shorten to Mischa . 'The argument is serious — it’s not a joke,' Kseniya, 33, told the New York Post. 'I don’t want to call my son something I can’t even pronounce.' According to the petition, Kseniya finds the name Spyridon 'archaic, base, bereft of elegance and unsuitable for a child living in 21st century America'. But Nicholas argues that his wife simply has not had the opportunity to grow to like the name, and that her 'Russian ear is not trained for the sweet, musical sounds of our Greek nomenclature'. Rich history: Nicholas says the name Spyridon 'has been held by the highest and most honored officials and patriots of both the U.S. and the former Soviet Union' However, the nights of 'bickering about it back and forth' may be moot: the couple does not even know for sure whether they are even having a son. 'My husband is convinced. He thinks he’s a psychic... he thinks he can see through the belly,' says Kseniya. In fact, if the couple has a girl, Nicholas is willing to let Kseniya choose the name; he also says that if they name their first born son Spyridon, his wife can choose the name of their second son. Mystery child: The couple doesn't yet know the sex of their baby; if it's a girl, Nicolas will surrender all naming rights to Kseniya . While they wait to find out, Nicholas is hoping to get 100,000 signatures supporting his choice — the magic number that his wife agreed would be enough for him to get his way. 'I’ll settle for 100,000 — this is an approximate population of my hometown Maladzyechna,' says Kseniya, who was born in Belarus. Nicholas is still far off from his goal, but his nuanced plea has so far garnered over 200 supporters.",

    "source": "It was once the edgiest place in town, attracting the word's biggest bands to its iconic stage - but 30 years later Cleveland's Variety Theater is silent. The venue was renowned for its rock concerts but everything changed in 1984 when heavy metal band Motorhead played a gig so loud it literally began to bring the house down. As the crowd went wild over the group's unique ear-shattering brand of music, the ceiling cracked and pieces of plaster began to fall on the audience - ending the concert and the life of the Variety Theater in one deafening shriek. Abandoned for 30 years: The Variety Theater in Cleveland was once a buzzing music venue but was closed down after the ceiling cracked during a Motorhead gig in 1984 . The power was cut off to stop the band from playing and two years later a judge ordered the theater to be sealed off for good. Built in 1927, The Variety Theater was home to one of the earliest single screen cinemas in Cleveland, Ohio, before becoming an iconic music venue. The 20,000 sq ft main stage hosted the likes of  Metallica, the Dead Kennedy's and R.E.M. before Motorhead's fatal performance on December 2 1984. Since then it has stayed abandoned and hidden from public eye until now, thirty years later, a photographer has captured a collection of eery images offering a fascinating glimpse into music history. Seph Lawless, the 37-year-old photojournalist from Cleveland who took these incredible pictures, said: 'I'm Cleveland born and raised and I've always been into rock and roll. 'This theater has gone down in folklore in my hometown and it always had that air of mystery when we were kids growing up. Crumbling and rotting remains: The once-iconic Ohio venue was sealed off on the order of a judge in 1986, two years after Motorhead's gig . 'It was really inspiring to go in and photograph the theater, it's something I've always wanted to do and at times it actually felt like I was stepping back in time. 'I love rock and roll music so it was just incredible, it was like a time capsule to that era and that all the bands who performed there were captured in the fabric of the building.' Seph is a photojournalist specialising in nostalgic pictures. He recently completed a trip around the United States where he took photographs of abandoned or neglected buildings in every state. Due to the efforts of The Friends of the Historic Variety Theater, an organization that owns the huge building, a scheme to regenerate the venue have been given a new lease of life. The group is said to have plans to spruce up the theater section of the building, turning it into a music venue once more. Slow decay of time: Many of the theater's wooden seats have fallen into disrepair while the staircase shows the effects of years of decay . Renowned venue: Before its closure, the theater hosted concerts from bands including Metallica, the Dead Kennedy's and R.E.M. Hidden from view: The stunning pictures were taken by 37-year-old photojournalist Seph Lawless, who has lived in Cleveland all his life . Silent halls: The walls are cracked and chipped and the tiles on the floor have rotted after three decades of abandonment . Ruled to be unsafe: The venue was closed after the ceiling cracked and pieces of plaster began to fall on the audience during a 1984 gig . Open for half a century: Built in 1927, The Variety Theater was home to one of the earliest single screen cinemas in Cleveland, Ohio, before becoming an iconic music venue . Regeneration: The Friends of the Historic Variety Theater have plans to spruce up the theater section of the building and rent out the structure’s eight retail store-fronts . Dated equipment: Most of the building's machinery has been languishing for years since the venue's unfortunate closure . 1920s-style décor: The theater had kept its vintage style for decades and left everything untouched when it was sealed up in 1986 . Enticing: Mr Lawless said the theater 'has gone down in folklore' in Cleveland and always 'had that air of mystery' to it when he was a child . Fatal concert: During Motorhead's 1984 gig, the power was cut off to stop the band from playing and two years later the venue was cosed . A glimpse of the past: A peek through a broken piece of wall reveals the lit up stage of the Variety Theater in dramatic fashion . Fascinating history: There are now plans to restore the decaying building to a live music venue . Coated in dust: Mr Lawless is a photojournalist specialising in nostalgic pictures. He recently completed a trip around the United States where he took photographs of abandoned or neglected buildings in every state .",
