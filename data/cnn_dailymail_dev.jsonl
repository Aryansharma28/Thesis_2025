{"article":"(The Hollywood Reporter)Richard Dysart, the Emmy-winning actor who portrayed the cranky senior partner Leland McKenzie in the slick, long-running NBC drama \"L.A. Law,\" has died. He was 86. Dysart, who also played Coach in the original 1972 Broadway production of Jason Miller's Pulitzer Prize-winning \"That Championship Season,\" died Sunday at home in Santa Monica after a long illness, his wife, artist Kathryn Jacobi, told The Hollywood Reporter. The acclaimed \"L.A. Law\" \u2014 created by Steven Bochco (who eventually handed off the series to David E. Kelley) and Terry Louise Fisher \u2014 aired for eight seasons from 1986 to 1994. For playing the founder of the firm McKenzie, Brackman, Chaney and Kuzak, Dysart was nominated for the Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series for four straight years, finally winning the trophy in 1992. \"I always had him in mind for that role,\" Bochco said in a 2002 interview with the Archive of American Television. \"He's so avuncular. So I reached out to him. You know, Dick is sort of an old hippie. So he went into his closet and tried to find a lawyer outfit, and he came to meet us wearing a suit and tie. He was perfect.\" \"We got together, mapped out the character's past to give us a basis from which to work, and it's all gone smoothly since then,\" Dysart said in a 1990 interview with The Seattle Times. \"Sometimes I worry \u2014 it's all been going too well \u2014 a role I love to play in a series that's about as good as you can get. Something's wrong!\" Perhaps Dysart's most memorable character arc on the show was when he was found in bed with power-hungry competitor Rosalind Shays (played by Diana Muldaur). He was one of the few actors to appear in every episode. Dysart's range of authority -figure parts ran right to the top. He limned Harry Truman in the CBS telefilm \"Day One\" and in the ABC miniseries \"War and Remembrance,\" both of which aired in 1989, and he was Henry L. Stimson, the 33rd U.S. president's Secretary of War, in the 1995 HBO telefilm \"Truman,\" starring Gary Sinise. Similarly, he played the Secretary of Defense in \"Meteor\" (1979). Hollywood Reporter: Most powerful people in N.Y. media . Dysart also performed extensively in the medical- (movie) field, performing enough doctor roles to, perhaps, qualify to practice. His two most memorable came in classic satires: in Paddy Chayevsky's scathing \"The Hospital\" (1971), starring George C. Scott (a good friend), and in \"Being There\" (1979), as Melvyn Douglas' doctor. He also was a doctor who died a gruesome death in John Carpenter's \"The Thing\" (1982) and a physician in such films as \"The Terminal Man\" (1974), \"The Falcon and the Snowman\" (1985) and \"Warning Sign\" (1985). Dysart portrayed J. Edgar Hoover in the 1993 USA telefilm \"Marilyn & Bobby: Her Final Affair\" and in Mario Van Peebles' \"Panther\" (1995). Dysart also excelled as cranky coots and shifty sorts. He portrayed a motel receptionist in Richard Lester's \"Petulia\" (1968); was the bad guy who battled Clint Eastwood in \"Pale Rider\" (1985); stood out as a power player in Oliver Stone's \"Wall Street\" (1987); and sold barbwire in \"Back to the Future III\" (1990). Dysart was born March 30, 1929, in Boston and raised in Maine. Following high school, he attended the Gould Academy in Bethel, Maine, for a year, served in the U.S. Air Force and attended Emerson College, where he graduated with a master's degree in speech communications. At the time, he was interested in a career in radio (he became fascinated with the medium in first grade, when he was bedridden for a year because of rheumatic fever) but was soon tempted by acting. He moved to New York on a whim and was able to land minor roles on TV and a part in an off-Broadway production of \"The Iceman Cometh\" opposite Jason Robards. In the mid-1960s, he joined the American Conservatory Theater and toured the country doing plays, then landed roles on Broadway in \"All in Good Time,\" \"The Little Foxes\" and \"A Place Without Doors.\" He received a Drama Desk Award for his performance in \"That Championship Season.\" Hollywood Reporter: Q&A with Liz Smith . Dysart's credits include an eclectic array of movies, including \"The Crazy World of Julius Vrooder\" (1974), \"The Day of the Locust\" (1975), \"The Hindenburg\" (1975), \"An Enemy of the People\" (1978), \"Prophecy\" (1979), \"Mask\" (1985) and \"Hard Rain\" (1998). On television, he was top-notch in the telefilms \"The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman\" (1974), \"The People vs. Jean Harris\" (1981), as Dwight D. Eisenhower in \"The Last Days of Patton\" (1986) and as studio chief Louis B. Mayer in \"Malice in Wonderland\" (1985). Survivors also include his stepson Arie and daughter-in-law Jeannine Jacobi, mother-in-law Lenore, brother and sister-in-law Nadine and John Jacobi and grandchildren Abby and Levi. A private memorial is being planned. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made to the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum, an outdoor theater in Topanga Canyon in the Los Angeles area. Dysart and Jacobi had a second home in the forests of British Columbia. He was lured out of retirement for his last onscreen appearance, the \"L.A. Law\" reunion telefilm of 2002. \"They remain timely, with cases about points of law that are still current,\" he said of watching \"L.A. Law\" reruns in a 2002 interview with The Bangor Daily News. \"[The show] was also one of the fathers of yuppiedom. It was very much of the times, and very Los Angeles.

{"article":"Kansas City Royals match against rivals the Chicago White Sox descended into a mass brawl yesterday. Umpires ejected a total of five players from both teams after the fight in the seventh inning of Thursday's game at Chicago's U.S. Cellular Field,  Illinois. A heated exchange between Royals starter Yordano Ventura and White Sox outfielder Adam Eaton sparked the brawl which saw players from both dugouts and bullpens flood the field, reported\u00a0New York Daily News. Chicago White Sox's Jeff Samardzija, center, in the brawl with Kansas City Royals players during the seventh inning of Thursday's game . Several punches were thrown and  Ventura, along with fellow teammates Lorenzo Cain and Edinson Volquez, was sent off along with Chicago's Chris Sale and Jeff Samardzija. Thursday's match began to get scrappy after the White Sox's Jose Abreu was hit in the arm by  Ventura's pitch in the fourth inning. The very next inning, Royals' Mike Moustakas was also hit in the arm, this time by a pitch from Chris Sale, leading to a warning for both teams. But things continued to escalate until Eaton hit a comebacker (a ball batted directly back to the pitcher) at Ventura in the seventh inning. The Royals starter picked up a ground ball but instead of throwing it to first for the out, he appeared to stop for a moment and stare at the pitcher. Umpires ejected a total of five players from both teams after the fight after the seventh inning of Thursday's game at Chicago's U.S. Cellular Field, Illinois . The pair exchanged words, and Eaton is alleged to have shouted an expletive at Ventura, who was said to have shouted one back before he threw to first base to end the inning. Things quickly turned ugly and both players had to be kept apart by teammates and umpires. But the whole of both teams ran onto the field for the brawl where there was pushing, shoving and even a few punches. The fight was beginning to calm down and Moustakas was escorting Ventura back to the dugout when Samardzija charged at Cain. However, he missed knocked over coach Mike Jirschele instead. Ventura told\u00a0ESPN Chicago\u00a0he regretted the way he'd handled himself. 'It was a messy situation, I got the ground ball and was unable to control my emotions in that play, and it turned out ugly,' Ventura said. Several punches were thrown and Kansas City's Ventura, Lorenzo Cain and Edinson Volquez were ejected along with Chicago's Chris Sale and Jeff Samardzija (pictured going down) The whole of both teams ran onto the field for the brawl where there was pushing, shoving and even a few punches in the brawl . '(Eaton) said something to me. I responded back to him,' he said. 'It wasn't my intention, but maybe he interpreted it from the way I fielded the ball, but it was a hard comebacker, kind of put me off-balance, at which point I took those steps that incited him and he responded back, clearly emotional.' Royals won the game 3-2 in 13 innings, which is the first of a four-game series. This is not the first time the Royals have had tensions with other teams. Last weekend, their clash with Oakland Athletics landed scrappy Ventura with a fine for his actions. He was\u00a0also  involved in the team's disagreements with the Los Angeles Angels. In the three-game series against the Athletics, the teams clashed almost every match until five players and coaches were thrown out of the finale. They included Royals reliever Kelvin Herrera, who threw that fastball behind the head of Brett  Lawrie and pointed to his own head in a threatening manner. He received a five-game suspension.","highlights":"Thursday's match between  two baseball heavyweights turned into a brawl .\nBegan after dispute between the Royals' Ventura and White Sox's Eaton .\nSparked a mass fight\u00a0with members of both teams running onto\u00a0the field .\nUmpired ejected a total of five players after the scrap at Chicago's stadium .","id":"9ebcbdadfeae21bb4774cc92520a40836553e14f"}
{"article":"Accused: Retired general Sir Frank Kitson (above) won a CBE for his service in the Army . A retired general is being sued over a murder in Northern Ireland more than 40 years ago. Sir Frank Kitson, who is 88, is accused in the case of Patrick Eugene Heenan, a Catholic killed by loyalists in 1973. It is the first time a retired senior officer has been personally sued over the Troubles. Yesterday however, Sir Frank said he was confused as to why he was being named because he was not even serving in Northern Ireland at the time. He learned of the legal action in a letter from a Belfast law firm at the weekend. Mr Heenan, 47, was killed when paramilitaries threw a grenade at a minibus carrying him and 14 others to a Belfast building site. His widow, Mary, is suing the Ministry of Defence and the general, claiming he died because of \u2018negligence and misfeasance\u2019. But Sir Frank told the Daily Mail he had no connection to the case. \u2018I wasn\u2019t even there in 1973,\u2019 he said. \u2018I was in Ireland from September 1970 until April 1972. I know nothing about what happened to Mr Heenan. 'I wasn\u2019t a policy maker, I was a commander of troops. I have absolutely no knowledge of Mr Heenan and I had gone from Ireland at the time of his death.\u2019 Baffled: Sir Frank (pictured), who is now 88, said he was confused as to why he was being named because he was not even serving in Northern Ireland at the time of the murder in 1973 . Sir Frank also denied the claim that he was in charge of military operations in Northern Ireland during the early 1970s: \u2018I was not. \u2018I was commanding one of three brigades. Above me there was a major general and a lieutenant general. \u2018We were working very closely with the police at the time, we have to make our plans together. We never instigated the use of paramilitary gangs.\u2019 Colonel Tim Collins \u2013 formerly of the 1st Battalion Royal Irish Regiment \u2013 described the decision to pursue General Kitson as strange. He added: \u2018Not only is it a strange case, it worries me that such an action is allowed by the authorities and the Government. \u2018What is also of concern is that there are people out there who are set to profit by taking cases such as these.\u2019 Kevin Winters, of law firm KRW, said: \u2018This week we have issued proceedings against the MoD and Frank Kitson on behalf of our clients, the relatives of Patrick Heenan. 'These are civil proceedings for damages but their core value is to obtain truth and accountability for our clients as to the role of the British Army and Frank Kitson in the counter-insurgency operation in the north of Ireland during the early part of the conflict.\u2019 Royal appointment: Sir Frank (far right) is pictured with the Queen, Major General Patrick Palmer (centre), and Lieutenant General Sir Edward Burgess (left) during a visit to York in May 1983 . He claimed loyalist paramilitary gangs were \u2018core to the Kitson military doctrine endorsed by the British Army and the British government at the time\u2019. Eugene Heenan, son of the murdered man, said he and his 88-year-old mother would travel to London on Thursday to generate publicity for the civil action. He added: \u2018Kitson may not have been in Ireland when my father was murdered but those who did were working to a template he had developed while in various countries and it is him who has to be held accountable.\u2019 Sir Frank has been named co-defendant in the legal action on grounds that he and others used agents when they knew, or should have known, that they would take part in criminal actions. He was awarded a CBE in February 1972 for \u2018gallant and distinguished\u2019 services in Northern Ireland from August 1971 to November 1971. He enjoyed a distinguished career, serving in Oman and Malaya and in Kenya during the Mau Mau rebellion, for which he received the Military Cross in 1955. The general rose to become commander-in-chief UK land forces from 1982 to 1985. Former soldier Albert \u2018Ginger\u2019 Baker received a life sentence for killing Mr Heenan and three others but he later claimed to have links to British intelligence. He was a member of the outlawed Ulster Defence Association and known to be a leading member of the so-called \u2018Romper Room\u2019 gang. Although no inquest was held into Mr Heenan\u2019s death, it has been claimed he could have survived had first aid been given quickly.","highlights":"Sir Frank Kitson, 88, accused in 1973 case of Patrick Eugene Heenan, 47 .\nFirst time a retired senior officer has been personally sued over Troubles .\nBut Sir Frank claims he was not even serving in Northern Ireland at time .\nMr Heenan died when paramilitaries threw grenade at bus carrying him .","id":"6d0f1a5aeba1ab5e99159b022d89172f6341b066"}

The Association of European Airlines confirmed last night that no other airline has attempted to charge for this and said customers should not be charged. However, a spokesman for easyJet defended the airline\u2019s position, saying: \u2018The administration charge for the letter is applied because each letter has to be individually researched and created for each passenger.\u2019 In an email seen by the Mail in response to one customer\u2019s request, easyJet\u2019s customer service team said: \u2018We can certainly send you a letter to help you claim on your insurance, that\u2019s not a problem. \u2018There is a small administration fee of 10GBP for the letter, which you should be able to claim back through your insurer.\u2019 There were delays and 1,000 flight cancellations across Europe this month following the 48-hour strike by French air-traffic controllers.

Neal's Yard Remedies created a tincture packed with the stuff, as well as a purifying blend of the skin-loving botanicals calendula, schisandra and gotu kola. Gotu kola helps stimulate collagen and tissue formation. It improves circulation, which benefits skin tone, and  has anti-inflammatory and skin-regenerating actions. When used internally, mahonia can improve bile flow, stimulate digestion and act as a tonic on the bowel wall . Antimicrobial herb calendula is rich in anti-ageing antioxidant beta-carotene, which is important for healthy skin structure and renewal. Also known as magnolia vine, schisandra has been used historically for immune support and for skin care. Modern Chinese research suggests it has a protective effect on the liver, so enhancing the cleansing benefits. The succulent globe artichoke, meanwhile, has been used in Chinese medicine for millennia as a digestive cleanser. It helps to purify and calm the system from within. It is recommended to add 2ml to a cupful of water three times a day to reap the rewards.","highlights":"The women of Japan swear by the 'beauty from within' philosophy .\nMahonia is a traditional herbal treatment for acne .\nBerry native to the Rocky Mountains that's been used by tribes for years .\nIts compounds give it antibacterial and anti-inflammatory benefits .","id":"0847361e0d8669fb49e7690f027460dfd7ce073c"}
{"article":"Fireman Stephen Hunt, 38, died after he and a colleague got into difficulties battling a fire started at Paul's Hair World in Manchester's Northern Quarter on July 13, 2013 . A 16-year-old girl charged with arson after she discarded a cigarette causing a city centre shop blaze which claimed the life of a firefighter had the charge dropped today after a judge said she was 'guilty only of being careless'. Fireman Stephen Hunt, 38, lost his life tackling the inferno which began at Paul's Hair World in Manchester's Northern Quarter almost two years ago. The girl - who was just 15 at the time - is said to have dropped a cigarette to the floor while standing near the shop's fire exit which rolled underneath the door and set boxes alight. She was originally charged with arson being reckless as to whether life was endangered, but was cleared having been due to stand trial on Monday. After more than a year of legal wrangling, with scientists initially stating that the fire could not have been started accidentally, further investigation led to the conclusion a discarded cigarette could have been the cause. More than 60 firefighters battled the blaze, which erupted on July 13, 2013, as frightened passers-by watched on. Father-of-two Mr Hunt, of Whitefield, Manchester, and another fireman, got into difficulties while tackling the fire and they were rushed to hospital where Mr Hunt was pronounced dead. At Manchester Crown Court, prosecutor Alexander Leach said thin and damaged cardboard boxes and paper labels stored behind the fire door at the business may well have caught fire if a cigarette was discarded. He said: 'Combined with the suggestion that boxes may have been on top of the smouldering cigarette, compressing and containing the heat, this made it more likely items would ignite. The salon was totally gutted when an inferno started by a discarded cigarette ripped through it. The 16-year-old girl who started the fire was today told she will not face trial for arson as she had only been 'careless' The family of Stephen Hunt visit the scene where he died. The girl who started the fire is said to have dropped a cigarette while standing near the shop's fire exit which rolled underneath the door and set boxes alight . Firefighters enter the remains of music venue NQ Live in Manchester which was also destroyed by the fire (left). Dozens of floral tributes to fireman Stephen Hunt were left at the scene (right) 'It was a hot day and there was a gap beneath the door and as a result experts were unable to exclude a chimney effect as air was drawn under the gap underneath the door and the fire began. 'The conclusion is the Crown's case, which had previously been based on scientific evidence which excluded accidental ignition, can no longer be sustained, so I offer no evidence.' The teenager, who did not attend court, was initially arrested along with another 15-year-old girl but she was the only one charged. Throwing the case out, Judge Michael Henshell said: 'I spent some time reading the papers and reports and it is perfectly obvious this terrible and tragic case demonstrates the danger and potential danger from discarded cigarettes. A fireman patrols the scene in Manchester's Northern Quarter where his colleague was killed. More than 1,000 firefighters, emergency service staff and members of the public lined the streets of Bury for Mr Hunt's funeral . More than 60 firefighters battled the blaze, which erupted on July 13, 2013, as passers-by watched on . 'This was discarded without any thought and as a result a fire started in circumstances which were particular to the site in question, resulting in extensive damage and costing the life of a man who, as part of his employment, was there to protect life and property. 'It was a terrible consequence for a thoughtless act. The girl who had been charged and faced trial was, in fact, blameless so far as criminal law is concerned and guilty only of being careless.' In September 2013 more than 1,000 firefighters, emergency service staff and members of the public lined the streets of Bury for Mr Hunt's funeral. In a tribute to him at his funeral, his son Sam said: 'To me, he wasn't just my dad but my hero, my role model and my best friend.' Following the hearing today, a spokesperson for Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said: 'We have made no comment on any aspect of the incident and are unlikely to do so until the coroner's inquest into Stephen's death has concluded. 'Safe to say we continue to work with everyone involved in various investigations to find the truth of what happened, not least for Stephen's family but for everyone involved and especially our firefighters.'","highlights":"Teenager charged with arson at Manchester hair salon will not face trial .\nInferno erupted at Paul's Hair World in Northern Quarter on July 13, 2013 .\nScientists initially stated the fire could not have been started accidentally .\nBut they now say discarded cigarette near the fire exit could have caused it .\nStephen Hunt, 38, died after he and colleague got into trouble tackling fire .","id":"f3565a58f5047d60bef05613ab9e1bc374f3155d"}

Sergio Aguero struck after eight minutes to give City the lead but they were blitzed by United in a 4-2 loss . Despite Balotelli's gloating, the defeat for City is actually more beneficial to his Liverpool side . While United's blitz of City went on to leave the Italian red-faced anyway, the fact that a defeat for the champions was beneficial for his current club will not have gone unnoticed either. Instead, Balotelli seemed to throw his weight behind his former employers rather than clinging on to Liverpool's slim hopes of Champions League qualification that look like they will only open up if City's slump continues.

{"article":"She may not look it, but this 72-year-old is a master con artist. Cathryn Parker has lived under at least 74 aliases in Los Angeles, mainly those of Hollywood production workers. But after 15 blissful years skipping over legal hurdles, it all came to a grinding halt when she was stopped for a traffic violation. Police started to investigate Parker after realizing she gave the traffic officers a false name. Tracking down her house, they found she was leasing under another false name. The case quickly unraveled into one of the biggest cases of identity theft the state has ever seen. Master con? Cathryn Parker, 72, has been living as 74 different people, mainly Hollywood production staffers . 'I've been a cop for 20 years... and this is the first case where I've had this many aliases,' LAPD's Detective Danny Gore told the LA Times. He predicted Parker would have continued to operate under the various identities for the rest of her life. 'It's like a way of life. I don't know that there was an end,' he remarked. 'You have to be dedicated.' Efforts to find a phone number for Parker were unsuccessful. It wasn't immediately known if she has an attorney. As of Friday, Parker was in federal custody in Northern California, where she was wanted for probation violations. She was convicted in 2000 for federal mail fraud in Hawaii after she used the Jenny Craig Corp's corporate travel account to purchase plane tickets and then sold the tickets privately for $500 apiece. Parker has repeatedly violated the terms of her release since then and was wanted by the U.S. Marshals, according to records. According to police, she also paid utilities under false names and acquired credit cards with other people's financial information. After she serves time in Northern California, she'll be sent down to Los Angeles County to answer for the alleged identity thefts, Deputy U.S. Marshal Laura Vega said. Until that time, investigators are looking for more victims. Though the current victims only date back to 2012, Gore said he believes there could be incidents going back to 2010.

{"article":"Shattering its windscreen, this is the incredible moment a bus ploughed into a passenger plane at Tashkent airport in Uzbekistan. The incident is difficult to comprehend as the collision was much more than just a minor skirmish on the tarmac at the busy Asian airport. The damage on the vehicle is clear, although it is unknown if the engine of the Boeing 777 jet was damaged or if anyone was injured. The bus ploughed into the engine of the Uzbekistan Airways Boeing 777 passenger jet . Tashkent is the largest international airport in Uzbekistan, and the busiest in Central Asia, so the crash will have more than likely delayed many passengers. The plane was believed to be an Uzbekistan Airways service, the national airline of the country, with its headquarters at Tashkent. MailOnline Travel has contacted Uzbekistan Airways and is awaiting comment. This kind of incident is unfortunately becoming more common. Ryanair passengers travelling to Edinburgh and Zadar, Croatia were delayed for hours after two of the budget airline\u2019s planes clipped wings at Dublin Airport back on April 1. Photos snapped by travellers show the tip of a winglet dangling by a thread after clipping the other plane - and it's the second time in six months two Ryanair planes have collided at Ireland's busiest airport. It's difficult to comprehend the moments leading up the crash as the force of impact is severe . Passengers escaped injury when the planes collided as they taxied to a runway shortly before 8am, but the incident caused disruption for hundreds of travellers. In October 2014 a Ryanair jet had its winglet torn off when it collided with another plane belonging to the budget carrier at Dublin Airport. The Boeing 737s heading to Edinburgh and Brussels were taxiing to a runway when they collided in darkness. In January this year a British Airways plane hit a hangar at Heathrow Airport, while being towed away for routine maintenance. As the Boeing 777-200 aircraft was being towed towards a hangar, someone misjudged the distance and the plane's wing clipped the wall of a nearby building. There were no injuries from the collision, and the airport and airline continued to operate normally for the rest of the day.","highlights":"Worrying incident happened at Tashkent Airport in Uzbekistan .\nFront windscreen of bus is shattered by impact with plane's engine .\nUnknown if there were any injured parties or cost of damage .","id":"4694076c87b1b39773f31c6bceaf5c5f5a262589"}
{"article":"(CNN)Pop star Taylor Swift, who has built an intense bond with her fans by sharing personal details of her life, revealed some sobering news Thursday: Her mother has cancer. The singer did not divulge the nature or severity of the cancer, saying \"I'd like to keep the details of her condition and treatment plans private.\" Andrea Swift, 57, who years ago quit her job as a mutual fund marketing executive to raise Swift and Swift's younger brother, Austin, has joined her famous daughter on tour and in several of her videos. In a post on Tumblr, the blogging platform, Swift said that for Christmas last year, she asked her mom to get screened for potential health issues, \"just to ease some worries of mine.\" Her mother felt \"perfectly fine\" but went to the doctor for tests anyway \"just to get me and my brother off her case\" about it. \"The results came in, and I'm saddened to tell you that my mom has been diagnosed with cancer. I'd like to keep the details of her condition and treatment plans private, but she wanted you to know,\" Swift added. #PrayForMamaSwift was a trending hashtag Thursday on Twitter, where Swift's legions of fans offered prayers and messages of support. Within an hour and a half, Swift's tweet about her mom had been retweeted more than 21,000 times. Many fans shared \"there's something in your eyes that says we can beat this,\" a lyric from Swift's 2008 song \"Change.\" Swift also urged her fans to make sure their parents get screened for cancer and other potential health problems. \"She wanted you to know because your parents may be too busy juggling everything they've got going on to go to the doctor, and maybe you reminding them to go get checked for cancer could possibly lead to an early diagnosis and an easier battle ...\" she wrote. \"Or peace of mind in knowing that they're healthy and there's nothing to worry about.\" Swift, 25, added that \"usually when things happen to me, I process them and then write music about how I feel, and you hear it much later.

{"article":"Rangers kept the pressure on Hibernian in the race for second spot in the Championship with a comfortable 4-0 win over Raith Rovers. Hibs had secured a win over Hearts in the Edinburgh derby in the earlier kick-off and the Light Blues knew they had to respond. They bounced back from Thursday's defeat by Queen of the South, with Nicky Clark and Haris Vuckic claiming a goal apiece and Nicky Law grabbing a double.

Rangers manager Stuart McCall applauds the home fans after the full-time whistle . The win means Rangers and Hibs remain level on 61 points, albeit the Leith side have the better goal difference. Stuart McCall had suffered his first defeat as Rangers manager against Queens last week. So it was no real surprise to see him make three changes for the visit of Raith. Goalkeeper Cammy Bell was back between the sticks and Dean Shiels and Robbie Crawford were also added to the side. The Light Blues enjoyed the best possible start to the game when they surged into the lead after just six minutes. Clark found himself in plenty of space to connect with Law's corner and bullet a header home from 10 yards. Law then carved out a chance of his own but his shot from just inside the box was weak and easily held by Kevin Cuthbert. But the goalkeeper had no chance when Gers claimed their second of the day after 27 minutes. Vuckic cut inside from the right before unleashing a powerful drive into the bottom corner to claim his seventh Rangers goal.

Raith could have pulled a goal back moments later but a well-struck free-kick from Ryan Conroy on the edge of the box was blocked by Bell. The visitors fired out another warning to Rangers shortly after the restart. Lewis Vaughan tried his luck with a snap-shot that fell inches past the upright as Raith tried to haul themselves back into the game. At the other end, the hosts passed up a decent chance to all but secure the three points. Vuckic released Crawford and he tried to tee up the shot for Law but he failed to connect in front of goal and the chance was lost. However Law was celebrating when he added his name to the scoresheet after 72 minutes, putting the game beyond Raith. Law's first attempt crashed off the crossbar but the ball fell kindly to his feet and he had the net bulging with the rebound from eight yards. Tom Walsh then saw a terrific volley saved well by the goalkeeper, before Law completed his double when he curled home from the edge of the box with two minutes to go.

{"article":"Margaret Gretton has been banned from classrooms for labelling an Asian job applicant 'Taliban' and calling special needs pupils 'roadkill' A primary school headteacher has been banned from classrooms for labelling an Asian job applicant 'Taliban' after referring to special needs pupils as 'roadkill'. Margaret Gretton, 46,\u00a0has been barred indefinitely from the profession after she referred to the applicant as a member of the terror group and talked of 'bombs and blowing up the school' in an Asian accent. A disciplinary panel of the National College for Teaching and Leadership in Coventry ruled Ms Gretton 'exhibited clear intolerance on the grounds of race, as well as disability'. The panel said she showed no remorse for 'deliberate' and 'repeated' actions while head of Burton Joyce Primary School in Nottingham. They heard that she had mocked special needs students by referring to them as 'cuckoo' and said she didn't want to encourage children 'like that' to come to the school. She even displayed a Golly magnet in her office and made 'monkey noises' on one occasion when talking about black people. Her shocking behaviour continued over a 'sustained period of time' while she was headteacher of the school from September 2007 until November 2013. The panel concluded Ms Gretton 'displayed racist attitudes and behaviour in that - on one or more occasions you inappropriately commented in relation to a photograph of a male Asian job applicant.' It said her comments included 'would you hire me\u2026I'm in the Taliban', or words to that effect, referring to the man as 'Mohammed', or words to that effect, and referring to 'bombs and blowing up the school', or words to that effect, in an Asian accent. A teacher at the school, named only as Staff Member E, told the panel that Ms Gretton said to her, unprompted: 'Do you like black men?' The teacher said she was 'taken aback' by the question, but added that it did not bother her, and her mother's partner was black and from Jamaica. She told the panel that Ms Gretton then 'burst out laughing and said words to the effect of 'does he have big lips?...does he look like a monkey?' and then went on to make monkey noises.' The headteacher denied making the comments, but the panel said it was 'satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the comments, or words similar to them, were made by Ms Gretton. ' The panel also found that she 'expressed inappropriate and discriminatory attitudes towards SEN [Special Educational Needs] pupils in the presence of school staff.' The panel said 'exhibited clear intolerance on the grounds of race, as well as disability' while head of Burton Joyce Primary School in Nottingham (pictured) They said she had used the word 'cuckoo' or words to that affect and said 'we don't want to encourage children like that to come here.' She was also found to have 'deliberately tried to upset' a special needs pupil, 'frightened him', and 'tried to make him cry.' Witness G gave evidence to the panel that on one occasion in 2010 a pupil would not come out from underneath a table and was disrupting the lesson so, as a teaching assistant, she asked Ms Gretton for assistance. She told the panel that 'Ms Gretton said 'It's like something from One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest' and said 'cuckoo, cuckoo' whilst twirling her finger at the side of her head.' A Special Education Needs co-ordinator, who also gave evidence to the panel, said that during a discussion in 2010 about creating a disabled parking space at the school car park she mentioned that Ms Gretton's parking space was the obvious place to put it. However she said that Ms Gretton said: 'We don't want to encourage people like that here.' Ms Gretton was also found to have bullied members of staff which the panel described as 'wholly unacceptable.' It concluded: 'The panel considered that Ms Gretton was not acting under duress, she lacked any insight into her behaviour and demonstrated no remorse. Her shocking behaviour continued over a 'sustained period of time' while she was headteacher of the school (pictured) \u00a0from September 2007 until November 2013 . 'Her actions towards staff and pupils were deliberate, repeated and over a sustained period of time. Ms Gretton seriously abused her position of power and trust within the school. ' After the panel made its recommendations Paul Heathcote, acting on behalf of the Secretary of State, decided to prohibit Ms Gretton from teaching indefinitely. He said: 'This is a case where the teacher has exhibited clear intolerance on the grounds of race, as well as disability.' He added: 'There has been no effort made by Ms Gretton to remedy the attitudinal deficiencies which have led her to behave in the way in which she did.' Describing his decision to prohibit the woman from teaching he said: ' This means that Ms Margaret Leandra Gretton is prohibited from teaching indefinitely and cannot teach in any school, sixth form college, relevant youth accommodation or children's home in England. 'Furthermore, in view of the seriousness of the allegations found proved against her, I have decided that Ms Margaret Leandra Gretton shall not be entitled to apply for restoration of her eligibility to teach.' Ms Gretton has right of appeal to the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court, until 28 days after she was given notice of the order.","highlights":"Margaret Gretton, 46, has been barred indefinitely from the profession .\nShe was headteacher of Burton Joyce Primary School in Nottingham .\nShe talked of 'bombs and blowing up the school' in an Asian accent .\nDisciplinary\u00a0panel concluded she\u00a0'exhibited clear intolerance on the grounds of race, as well as disability'","id":"6b232ac845057c0a1e8e3b37fab53bb7cc931202"}
{"article":"From the dry, relentless heat of Alice Springs to the icy cold hills of Canberra, a university student will push his body to the limit, running a marathon in each of Australia\u2019s eight states and territories to honour the memory of his late, treasured childhood friend. Although he had never run a marathon before, Callum Ryan, 21, committed himself to the daunting challenge of running eight of them between January and September 2015 - covering a total distance of 337.5 kilometres. His \u2018Eight Great States\u2019 campaign is driven by his passion to make a difference after the loss of his friend, Malachy Frawley who died from heart disease in 2013 when he was just 14 years old. Callum is preparing to battle vastly different weather conditions and diverse terrains as he pounds the pavement right around Australia, raising funds for not-for-profit organisation HeartKids Australia - supporting thousands of children living with heart defects. Callum posing like international running champion Usain Bolt at the finish line after the Canberra Times Marathon on April 12, with his little sister Josie and brother Henrik . Callum Ryan poses with his treasured friend Malachy Frawley, who sadly passed away when he was 14 . Malachy Frawley brought\u00a0laughter to the world in his short but wonderful life, showing great courage through his lifelong battle with the severe heart condition Hypoplastic Right Heart Syndrome . The University of Sydney student has committed himself to the incredible endeavour in memory of a Malachy, who brought laughter to the world in his short but wonderful life, showing great courage through his lifelong battle with the severe heart condition Hypoplastic Right Heart Syndrome. Callum is inspired by the incredible strength and resilience Malachy displayed as he faced the challenges of a Congenital Heart Disease, which severely affected his mobility. Since January, Callum has already faced his first three marathons: kicking it all off with a 22 degree race in Hobart, sweating through the 28 degree heat in the Victoria town of Wangaratta and freezing through an icy seven degree start in Canberra. With each race, Callum has improved on his previous time by at least ten minutes. This comes despite his muscle fatigue with the quick turnaround as he pushes his body to recover and do it all again! The worst is yet to come, as Callum is scheduled to run a marathon in Darwin and then summon the strength to run another in Perth just 14 days later - and another 21 days after that in Sydney. Despite Malachy being five years Callum's junior, they forged a truly special friendship . 'Finished first! (out of all the people running to raise money for HeartKids obviously)' Callum joked after he finishing the Wangaratta marathon in sweltering, 35 degree heat . Eight Great States: One man, eight marathons, eight states and territories, nine months, 337.56 kilometres . Every step of the way, the memory of Malachy is never far from Callum's mind \u2013 helping him to find the mental strength to make it to the finish line. \u2018At times during the race I thought \u201cit\u2019d be easier to stop now, no one would think any worse of you because a marathon is a tough thing to try\u201d,' Callum said. \u2018But I set out to do this. As I run, I sometimes think of Malachy and the thousands and thousands of other kids in that situation.' 'While I was running I thought about kids with Congenital Heart Disease and their families.' Callum is conscious of how lucky he is to be healthy and able to complete a marathon. Every step of the way, the memory of Malachy is never far from Callum's mind \u2013 helping him to find the mental strength to make it to the finish line . Malachy was the beloved younger brother of Niamh, Imogen and Seamus, growing up in NSW's Nowra . HeartKids made incredible changes to Malachy's life (pictured with his father Dom and mother Maggie). They supplied him with a segway so he could be more mobile and have his own independence . Hobart was the perfect location for Callum to embark on his first ever marathon - an ideal 22 degrees . \u2018Children with CHD struggle to walk around in their day to day lives because their bodies aren't equipped. \u2018I had to stick to my challenge because they find that strength every day.\u2019 \u2018I disappeared into those types of thoughts and the kilometres fell away.\u2019 \u2018With the personal connection none of it feels like a chore or a risk.\u2019 He hopes to make people aware of the plight of children with heart disease and the need to support the children and their families. Every day in Australia, eight babies are born with a heart defect. Every week, four precious lives are lost and vital research needs to take place to work out of how to save them. \u2018\u2018I first came across HeartKids through Malachy.

When Malachy was in kindergarten the pair were excited to discover Callum had also been allocated as Malachy\u2019s Year Six buddy \u2013 a mentor and friendly face across the playground. Despite Malachy being five years his junior, they forged a truly special friendship. \u2018They had a very lovely friendship. They had the chance to get to know each other despite being five years apart,\u2019 explained Malachy\u2019s father, Dr Dom Frawley. \u2018Lucky enough for Callum and Malachy they were paired up and their personalities really gelled. Although he had never run a marathon before, Callum Ryan, 21, committed himself to the daunting challenge of running eight of them between January and September 2015 . Since January, Callum has already faced his first three marathons: including sweating through the 28 degree heat in the Victoria town of Wangaratta (r) and freezing through a seven degree start in Canberra (l) \u2018Malachy looked up to Callum a lot as a mentor and Callum took that role seriously and invested a lot of time in Malachy. \u2018They got the chance to discover they had a lot in common in the way they saw and thought about things, particularly in the way they were so creative.\u2019 In his fourteen short years, Malachy left his mark on the world \u2013 creating, daydreaming and making people smile. Malachy has been remembered as \u2018an author, film director, comedian, drummer, raconteur and HeartKids.\u2019 He was adored for his \u2018wit and loving nature.\u2019 Malachy was affected by one of the most serious heart conditions, which greatly affected his mobility. Although Callum will be travelling to many marathons alone during his Eight States campaign, he travelled via Camry with his great mate Nick Peters to his third marathon in the ACT . Dom and his family have been greatly touched by Callum\u2019s (third from left) commitment to making a change in the life of other children . He had needed to rely on others to drive or piggyback up from place to place, until HeartKids gifted him with a Segway. \u2018The Segway completely transformed his life,\u2019 said his father Dom. \u2018He could suddenly get places without having to rely on people to carry him, which was quite a dramatic change from what he\u2019d always been able to do.\u2019 Their boy with a quick wit and limitless imagination now had the freedom of movement and increased independence, able to travel around his neighbourhood and to and from school. \u2018I left the training a bit late before my first marathon, frankly. I felt really nervous before my first marathon, thinking \u201chave I done enough?\u201d\u2019. Dom and his family have been greatly touched by Callum\u2019s commitment to making a change in the life of other children. \u2018We\u2019re very gratified and we\u2019re touched by it. Hopefully it will help a lot of people with the sickness to raise funds and awareness. \u2018It\u2019s great for him to have that awareness. Callum cares a lot about people.\u2019 You can donate to Callum's Eight Great States campaign to help HeartKids here .

{"article":"STYLE OVER SUBSTANCE . This game is being billed as Beauty v the Beast, but don\u2019t underestimate Arsene Wenger. It\u2019s not just about style \u2014 he plays to win. The philosophy Wenger has imposed has made Arsenal popular throughout the world. People love to watch them, certainly more than Jose Mourinho\u2019s teams. But on Sunday, he is up against the ultimate pragmatist \u2014 Mourinho finds any way to win. Chelsea have conceded just two goals in their last six clashes with Arsenal, keeping four clean sheets in the process. Mourinho does exactly what\u2019s necessary. So while Wenger always aims to win, he still cares about the brand of football played. Mourinho\u2019s brand is winning. Arsene Wenger (left) pushed Jose Mourinho when Chelsea beat Arsenal 6-0 at Stamford Bridge last season . Wenger can not be underestimated, according to Martin Keown... it's not all about style, he plays to win . TALKING TACTICS . Arsenal should dominate possession while Chelsea are more likely to sit deep and use the electric pace of Eden Hazard and Willian on the break. Chelsea will be very disciplined and in some ways that is a shame because the players aren\u2019t allowed to express themselves as they might. In the reverse fixture in October, Chelsea pressed Arsenal all over and Wenger\u2019s side were stifled \u2014 they did not get a shot on target for the first time in a Premier League match since 2003. Jose creates such an intensity and focus that winning becomes a matter of life and death. But Arsenal will send waves of players forward at pace and try to isolate Branislav Ivanovic, Gary Cahill and John Terry, who are not the quickest. Keown (right) and Wenger go back a long way, after Keown's two stints at Arsenal during his career . Chelsea boss Mourinho always finds a way to win and has a brilliant record against Wenger . CHANGE THE RECORD . Mourinho's record over Wenger is remarkable. Not many managers can say they have never lost to Arsene Wenger. Jose feels he knows Wenger\u2019s game and the Arsenal boss can\u2019t surprise him. I\u2019d be amazed if Chelsea go all out to attack, but they will still pack a punch on the break. FLAVOUR OF THE MONTH . Jose wants to win every trophy going but he has a poor record in the Premier League Manager of the Month award. He has only won it three times, the same as Alan Curbishley and one fewer than Joe Kinnear. Wenger has won it 14 times. THE CESC DIFFERENCE . Cesc Fabregas has enjoyed a brilliant season at Chelsea but I don\u2019t think he would have necessarily benefited Arsenal had he joined. That central midfield area is very congested and he would have halted Aaron Ramsey\u2019s progress. But one thing is certain on Sunday \u2014 he won\u2019t receive a warm welcome. Mourinho has a poor Premier League Manager of the Month record; he has won as many as Alan Curbishley . Cesc Fabregas has been impressive this season, but he wouldn't necessarily have been as good with Arsenal .","highlights":"Chelsea travel to the Emirates to face Arsenal on Sunday afternoon .\nJose Mourinho has an impressive record against Arsene Wenger .\nDespite that, Wenger cannot be underestimated - he plays to win .\nCesc Fabregas has impressed this season, but he would not necessarily have had the same impact if he had joined Arsenal from Barcelona .","id":"c63a2e8c41da0461bae5c913c23044c8ebaff1a0"}
{"article":"For those who like their plot lines thick and brimming with intrigue, steering clear of Paisley last night seemed the judicious option. A Celtic side with the scent of the Treble in their nostrils facing a St Mirren outfit badly in danger of entering free-fall scarcely looked like a recipe for a Friday-night thriller. And yet, for all Ronny Deila\u2019s side prevailed in the end, this scrap provided compelling evidence that they won\u2019t simply be given a free ride towards a fourth successive title in the coming weeks. Celtic winger Kris Commons (right) has a shot on goal during the SPL match against St Mirren on Friday . St Mirren's Jim Goodwin slides in with a challenge on Celtic midfielder\u00a0Stefan Johansen at St Mirren Park . St Mirren (4-4-2): Ridgers, Naismith, McAusland, Genev, Tesselaar, Goodwin, Dayton (Thompson 78), Mallan (Sonupe 77), McGinn, Sadlier (Morgan 73), Arquin . Subs not used: Kelly, Gow, Reilly, Wilks . Booked:\u00a0Goodwin, Genev . Celtic (4-4-2): Gordon, Matthews (Ambrose Emuobo 65), Van Dijk, Denayer, Izaguirre, Brown, Johansen, Forrest, Commons (Mackay-Steven 72), Armstrong (Bitton 66), Stokes . Subs not used:\u00a0Guidetti, Zaluska, Griffiths, McGregor . Scorers: Forrest 64 . Referee: Alan Muir . St Mirren may be at the bottom of the Premiership table and still four points from even a play-off spot but, on this showing, they aren\u2019t out of it yet. They frustrated Celtic for the most part here, their energy and belief taking them so far \u2014 but not far enough. James Forrest was the man whose intervention broke Gary Teale\u2019s heart with a second half tap-in while any realistic chance of an unlikely comeback was killed off when Stefan Johansen later converted from the penalty spot. Now eight points clear of Aberdeen, however, Deila\u2019s misgivings about a far from perfect display will be tempered with a realisation that the title is edging ever closer to his grasp. The Celtic boss made four changes from the side which won the last of the four game-series with Dundee United before the international break. St Mirren goalkeeper\u00a0Mark Ridgers (centre) comes out to punch the ball clear of the head of Jason Denayer . Commons (right) and Ste Mirren's John McGinn (left) tussle for the ball during the SPL match on Friday . St Mirren's Jason Naismtih (right) battles with Stuart Armstrong (left) during the SPL match in Paisley . Out went Efe Ambrose, Nir Bitton, Gary Mackay-Steven and John Guidetti with Adam Matthews, Anthony Stokes, Kris Commons and Forrest the beneficiaries. Surprisingly, given the poverty of his side\u2019s display in the defeat to St Johnstone, Teale made only three alterations with Kieran Sadlier, Marc McAusland and Yoann Arquin restored to the side. St Mirren\u2019s attempts to address the obvious quality gap with guts and industry bore early fruit. With next to no time on the ball, Celtic were unable to find their rhythm let alone a killer pass. Commons, typically, was the man who found the space others couldn\u2019t in order to fashion the first chance. Dropping into a pocket of space behind the Saints defence, he gathered Scott Brown\u2019s incisive pass then shaped as if to cross. His attempt to beat Mark Ridgers at his near post was audacious but unsuccessful as the goalkeeper turned the ball around the post. Now playing without the burden of international football, Commons looked better for the break. When Johansen picked him out 30 yards from goal, he glided away from three challenges before lashing a shot into the side-netting. Largely written off as relegation certainties after their last dire outing in Perth, no one could accuse St Mirren of not giving it their all as they sought to claim an unlikely bonus point to help their plight. Celtic's James Forrest (left) tussles for the ball with St Mirren's\u00a0Jeroen Tesselaar (right) on Friday night . St Mirren' s Yoann Arquin (left) has a shot at goal but it is saved by Celtic goalkeeper Craig Gordon (centre) Celtic really ought to have taken the lead in 26 minutes. Stuart Armstrong had started the game with a couple of heavy touches but his pass to Commons was perfectly weighted. Commons took one touch to control and a second to blast the ball towards Ridgers\u2019 goal. The keeper blocked smartly, though. St Mirren then finally worried Craig Gordon. Sadlier danced away from Matthews on the flank and found the space between Celtic\u2019s central defenders where Stephen Mallan was lurking. His header floated towards the keeper\u2019s top corner but never with the required velocity to beat him. Ridgers was earning his corn. When Commons turned provider for Forrest, the winger looked to have picked his spot in the bottom corner with a side-foot only for the keeper\u2019s agility to leave the Celtic star with his head buried in his hands. It served to embolden the home side. Armstrong\u2019s tackle on Sadlier inadvertently set up Arquin but the striker seemed spooked by the chance and fired weakly into Gordon\u2019s arms. Deila isn\u2019t renowned for endangering crockery collections at half-time in dressing rooms up and down the land but it can safely be assumed he had a few choice words for a Celtic side that been some way short of sparkling in the first period. Celtic manager Rory\u00a0Deila (left) gives instructions to his captain Scott Brown (right) against St Mirren . Forrest slides on his knees to celebrate scoring Celtic's opening goal against St Mirren on Friday night . Armstrong\u2019s dipping shot from 20 yards was a yard shy of changing the narrative of the night within 60 seconds of the restart before Stokes\u2019 snap-shot was easily claimed by Ridgers. When Jeroen Tesselaar needlessly conceded a corner, he was grateful to the goalkeeper for punching Jason Denayer\u2019s header off his line. Commons smashed the spoils low into the side-net. Mallan issued a timely reminder that St Mirren were still very much in the game with a strike that had Gordon scrambling. The Saints midfielder sprawled to the turf after a foot sprint with Brown on the counter-attack but ref Alan Muir wasn\u2019t interested. Just as the Buddies looked to have the measure of the league leaders \u2014 so much so that Deila was looking to his bench \u2014 one moment of slackness cost them dear. Brown was the catalyst with a supreme pass in behind Tesselaar, taking the Dutchman out of the game and holding up perfectly for Matthews. Celtic midfielder\u00a0Johansen slots home from the penalty spot to secure his side's 2-0 victory at St Mirren . The Welshman\u2019s low cross was accurate and turned home with a flash of Forrest\u2019s boot at the far post \u2014 his second goal in three games. With that, Matthews and Armstrong departed to be replaced by Bitton and Ambrose before Mackay-Steven came on for Commons. Saints, to their huge credit, stuck to their task with Jim Goodwin, who had been harshly booked in the first half, seemingly at the heart of everything. Some 11 minutes from time, the result was put beyond all reasonable doubt. Forrest\u2019s shot did strike Viktor Genev on the arm but there seemed a case to be made in mitigation that it was not deliberate. The Bulgarian was booked for squabbling with Muir\u2019s decision but the delay didn\u2019t perturb Johansen who calmly sent Ridgers the wrong way from 12 yards.","highlights":"Celtic extend their lead at the top of the Scottish Premiership table .\nJames Forrest scored the opener for the visitors before Stefan Johansen made sure of three points from the penalty spot .\nSt Mirren remain bottom of the league table with 21 points .","id":"edf0c6f0c511e21a37116da9f9ab031e18b0c6f0"}

{"article":"Turkey has blocked access to Twitter and YouTube after they refused a request to remove pictures of a prosecutor held during an armed siege last week. A Turkish court imposed the blocks because images of the deadly siege were being shared on social media and 'deeply upset' the wife and children of Mehmet Selim Kiraz, the hostage who was killed. The 46-year-old Turkish prosecutor died in hospital when members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front (DHKP-C) stormed a courthouse and took him hostage. The DHKP-C is considered a terrorist group by Turkey, the European Union and US. Scroll down for video . A Turkish court has blocked access to Twitter and YouTube after they refused a request to remove pictures of prosecutor\u00a0Mehmet Selim Kiraz held during an armed siege last week . Grief: The family of Mehmet Selim Kiraz grieve over his coffin during his funeral at Eyup Sultan Mosque in Istanbul, Turkey. He died in hospital after he was taken hostage by the far-left organisation . Two of his captors were killed when security forces took back the building where the far-left group was holding him. Gunshots were heard and smoke could be seen rising from the scene at the end of the six-hour stand-off. Mr Kiraz, a father-of-two married to a judge who also worked at the courthouse, was targeted for his part in an investigation into the death of Berkin Elvan. The 15-year-old was severely wounded after being hit on the head by a tear-gas canister fired by a police officer during anti-government protests in Istanbul in June 2013. After spending 269 days in a coma, Elvan eventually died on March 11 last year. His death, and the subsequent investigation, have since become a rallying point for the country's far-left. Gathering: Prosecutors, lawyers and judges stand near a statue of Lady Justice during the funeral ceremony . A British national, of\u00a0Polish origin but who has not been named, was arrested on Saturday as part of an operation against the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front, according to reports. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said this morning: 'I can confirm that a British national has been arrested in Turkey and that we are offering consular assistance.' Before imposing the blocks on the websites, Turkish authorities had tried to prevent newspapers printing images taken during the siege last week. The newspapers were accused by the government of 'spreading terrorist propaganda' in sharing the images of the hostage-taking. Presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said: 'This has to do with the publishing of the prosecutor's . picture. What happened in the aftermath (of the prosecutor's . killing) is as grim as the incident itself. 'The demand from the prosecutor's office is that this image . not be used anywhere in electronic platforms. 'The wife and children of prosecutor Kiraz have been deeply . upset. The images are everywhere.' He added: 'A request has been made to both Twitter and YouTube for the . removal of the images and posts but they have not accepted it . and no response has been given. 'That's why . this decision has been taken through a court in Istanbul.' Critical: Prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz was taken to hospital with gunshot wounds but died of his injuries . Strength of feeling: Elvan has since become an icon for the Turkish far-left and his supporters accuse the authorities of covering up the circumstances and perpetrators of his death . Google said it was working to restore service to the YouTube . video-sharing site, which it owns. Twitter also said it was . working to restore access for its users. Facebook said it had complied with a Turkish court order requiring it to restrict access to some content or face a block on its service. A company spokesman said it would appeal the order. Turkey's telecoms regulator could not immediately be reached . and there was no statement on its website. This is not the first time that Turkish authorities have imposed blocks on social media sites and networks.

{"article":"Patients tried and failed to book almost 34 million GP appointments last year, shocking new figures have revealed. A\u00a0study\u00a0reported in the British Medical Journal found that\u00a090 per cent of patients were able to get an appointment in 2013\/14. The 10 per cent who could not amounts to around 33.8 million unsuccessful attempts each year - or 81 per surgery each week. The shambolic situation is responsible for as many as a quarter of A&E visits, the researchers say. Lack of access:\u00a0Patients tried and failed to book almost 34 million GP appointments last year . The figures, from the GP Patient Survey, also show that patients who report worse access to conventional GP appointments are more likely to use out-of-hours   services. And surgeries where patients were able to see a GP within two week days had lower\u00a0rates of A&E department visits. Other research has suggested that greater access to GP surgeries is linked with lower rates of emergency admissions for conditions such as heart failure and stroke. The figures\u00a0come\u00a0just a day after it was revealed one in five visits to A&E are unnecessary. A fifth of patients turning up in A&E have self-treatable conditions including sore throats, athlete\u2019s foot and head lice, a study has claimed. Researchers have calculated that more than 4 million visits a year are unnecessary \u2013 costing the NHS \u00a3290 million. Doctors have even reported patients showing up because they were hungover, their false nails were hurting or they had paint in their hair. The analysis of data from 15 A&E units by consultancy firm IMS Health found that 19 per cent of patients had what is called a \u2018self-treatable condition\u2019. The data covered one in ten A&E units across England, so if the trends are mirrored across the country, then an estimated 4.1million of the 21.7million visits last year were for minor ailments. The problem is largely caused by the fact that patients find it difficult to see a GP, particularly out of hours. Many go to A&E in the knowledge that they will at least be seen by a doctor that day, even if they have to wait four hours. Today's piece, written by academics from Imperial College London and New York University, points out that more GPs are required if access is to be improved. But they add politicians' promises of an extra 5,000 to 8,000 GPs are likely to be challenging to achieve. Effect: The situation is responsible for as many as a quarter of A&E visits, the researchers say. The new figures come just a day after it was revealed a fifth of patients turning up to casualty have self-treatable conditions including sore throats, athlete\u2019s foot and head lice . So despite election pledges by the Tories and Labour to improve access to GPs appointments, they argue these promises are unlikely to be achieved within a parliamentary term. The 'public should [therefore] question the promises of politicians', they said. The BMJ report said largest increase in GPs over a previous parliamentary term in the past 20 years was 5,414 GPs (from 2004\/05 to 2008\/09) under Labour. But Labour's previous pledge for all appointments within 48 hours was 'far from being achieved', it adds. Only 81 per cent of patients ended up able to see a GP within two weekdays in 2009\/10 when the party was last in government. The researchers add there is also no firm proof that more patients getting to see their doctor will lead to fewer A&E attendances. David Cameron has promised patients will be able to access GP surgeries between 8am and 8pm seven days a week by 2020 if the Tories are re-elected. Ed Miliband has guaranteed appointments within 48 hours if Labour are voted in. But the piece said these pledges may prove unrealistic, adding that the evidence behind them has not been made clear - and the problem with access has not been precisely defined. Denial: The study authors say that despite election pledges by the Tories and Labour (David Cameron and Ed Miliband are pictured, left to right) to improve access to GPs appointments, these promises are unlikely to be achieved within a parliamentary term . 'The aims and rationale of the policies outlined by the Conservative and Labour parties do not seem explicit,' the analysis said. 'One aim is undoubtedly to win election votes. But the aims for the NHS and for patients are less clear.' The analysis suggests five points of action 'for policy and research if improvements in access are pursued'. These are: . * Evaluating the extended opening hours pilot scheme carried out by the Tories . * Making general practice consultation data routinely available . * Looking at employing practice staff besides GPs . * Evaluating new types of appointment such as telephone consultations . * Considering alternatives to general practice such as pharmacist-led minor illness services. Lead author Thomas Cowling, of Imperial College London, said: 'Both parties have made bold promises about access to GP services, but the evidence behind their pledges is lacking. 'It's important that policies like extended access are independently evaluated before being implemented more widely. 'The pledges on increases to the GP workforce are very ambitious and unlikely to be met within a parliamentary term.' Instead, he recommended the NHS evaluates the use of new types of appointment that have been proposed to increase GP capacity, such as consultations and triage by phone or online. 'It should also consider other types of staff who could take on some of the work of GPs.'","highlights":"Study: 90 per cent of patients were able to get an appointment in 2013\/14 .\n10 per cent who couldn't amounts to 33.8 million unsuccessful attempts .\nSituation is\u00a0responsible\u00a0for a quarter of A&E visits, say researchers .\nProblem is more to do with lack of doctors rather than opening hours .","id":"bace32d78918588e8832c07d70cbc8465f50a1cb"}
{"article":"Liverpool target Neto is also wanted by PSG and clubs in Spain as Brendan Rodgers faces stiff competition to land the Fiorentina goalkeeper, according to the Brazilian's agent Stefano Castagna. The Reds were linked with a move for the 25-year-old, whose contract expires in June, earlier in the season when Simon Mignolet was dropped from the side. A January move for Neto never materialised but the former Atletico Paranaense keeper looks certain to leave the Florence-based club in the summer. Neto rushes from his goal as Juan Iturbe bears down on him during Fiorentina's clash with Roma in March . Neto is wanted by a number of top European clubs including Liverpool and PSG, according to his agent . It had been reported that Neto had a verbal agreement to join Serie A champions Juventus at the end of the season but his agent has revealed no decision about his future has been made yet. And Castagna claims Neto will have his pick of top European clubs when the transfer window re-opens in the summer, including Brendan Rodgers' side. 'There are many European clubs interested in Neto, such as for example Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain,' Stefano Castagna is quoted as saying by Gazzetta TV. Firoentina goalkeeper Neto saves at the feet of Tottenham midfielder Nacer Chadli in the Europa League . 'In Spain too there are clubs at the very top level who are tracking him. Real Madrid?

Neto, who represented Brazil at the London 2012 Olympics but has not featured for the senior side, was warned against joining a club as a No 2 by national coach Dunga. Neto joined Fiorentina from\u00a0Atletico Paranaense in 2011 and established himself as No1 in the last two seasons.","highlights":"Fiorentina goalkeeper Neto has been linked with Liverpool and Arsenal .\nNeto joined Firoentina\u00a0from Brazilian outfit Atletico Paranaense in 2011 .\nHe is also wanted by PSG and Spanish clubs, according to his agent .\nCLICK HERE for the latest Liverpool news .","id":"caabf9cbdf96eb1410295a673e953d304391bfbb"}
{"article":"Former Leeds and England coach Tony Smith admits he was shocked by Kevin Sinfield's decision to switch codes but, on reflection, believes it could be an inspired decision. Sinfield, 34, the greatest captain in Leeds' history, stunned the world of rugby league with his sudden announcement that he will quit the sport at the end of the season and join the Rhinos' sister club Yorkshire Carnegie on an 18-month contract. Sinfield, who is closing in on third place in rugby league's all-time scoring list with 3,997 points, told a news conference at Headingley he did not want to play against Rhinos and that the opportunity to spearhead Carnegie's bid for a Premiership return was too good to resist. Leeds Rhinos captain Kevin Sinfield is to switch codes and join Yorkshire Carnegie at the end of the season . Sinfield (centre) lifts the Super League trophy after Leeds beat Warrington in the grand final in October 2012 . Warrington coach Tony Smith (left) speaks with fellow coaches Tony Rea and Brian McDermott . Smith, who was in charge of the Rhinos when Sinfield lifted the first of their six Super League titles in 2003, says he is sad to see his former skipper swap codes. 'I was a bit shocked,' Smith said. 'It took me a couple of minutes to think about it. He's a champion player, he's been a champion player for his club and his country for many years. 'I'm sad to lose him to that other code. However, I could understand the rationale. If it's a way of him plying his trade for longer - his trade of playing rugby and being a terrific professional - I can see why he's made that change. 'I think he'll have a lot to still contribute to their sport and to that club. It's not a huge switch for him in terms of training venues. 'He'll still have his bumps and bruises, but the fact that he can continue to do that and probably get well rewarded for it, I can't blame him.' Sinfield, whose bombshell announcement came just four days after his predecessor as England captain Jamie Peacock revealed he would be leaving Leeds at the end of the season to become football manager at Hull KR, has missed Leeds' last two games through injury and, according to Smith, is probably stepping down at the right time. Sinfield (left) in action for England against France during the 2013 Rugby League World Cup quarter-final . Sinfield is tackled during a match between Leeds Rhinos and Leigh Centurions last year . 'I think it's fantastic to make that decision to bow out of Super League probably at the right time,' Smith added. 'You can't keep playing forever and, when those young guys come snapping at your heels, it's hard to keep them at bay at some stage. 'You have to bite the bullet and step aside and I'd say the time is probably right. I'm no expert on when other people should retire but I'm pleased for Kevin and he'll certainly give everything he's got to his new employers. 'That's how he's been in rugby league and I've got no reason to think it'll be any different.' Sinfield has never played rugby union but already identified a role for himself in his new sport as he follows in the footsteps of Jason Robinson, Andy Farrell and Sam Burgess. 'Ideally I'd like to play fly-half,' Sinfield said. 'It's the position that suits the skill set I have the best. Sinfield and his Leeds team-mates celebrate after beating Melbourne Storm in the 2008 World Club Challenge . 'I understand the challenge that's in front of me and the difficulties rugby league players have faced crossing over. That's why I think I'm in the best possible place to help with that transition. 'Playing union is something I've always wanted to do. I didn't want to end my career and have regrets about missed opportunities. When this opportunity came up I knew it was the right thing. 'I'm excited by it. I know the potential at the club and it's something I'd like to be a part of. 'I'm very respectful of the game and I like watching it. I think a lot of rugby league people look down on rugby union, and I think a lot of rugby union people look down on rugby league. But I like both games. As a sportsman, to get the opportunity to play another professional sport is something that really appeals to me.'","highlights":"Kevin Sinfield has announced he is leaving Leeds at the end of the season .\nThe 34-year-old will cross codes to join sister club Yorkshire Carnegie .\nSinfield has won six Super League titles, three World Club Challenges and one Challenge Cup with the Rhinos .","id":"266240ecac4086150063a0086473eab55727b3b3"}
{"article":"Jason Orange shocked Take That fans around the world when he quit the chart-topping band last September but he hasn't said goodbye to them forever. Busy man: Gary Barlow is preparing for his musical Finding Neverland to open and the new Take That tour to begin . For as the remaining members Gary Barlow, Mark Owen and Howard Donald prepare to hit the road as a trio on their new tour - opening in Glasgow on April 27 - Gary has revealed to MailOnline that Jason will be proudly cheering on his former bandmates. Speaking exclusively to MailOnline ahead of the premiere of his new Broadway musical Finding Neverland on Wednesday, Gary said: 'He wants to come to the shows, he'll definitely be there. I don't think we'll be able to get him up on stage but he'll be there.' Regarding Jason's departure, Gary added: 'I think we've gotten used to it. It was very strange to start with it but it's been over six months. 'We're just so excited to hit the road. People come to a Take That show expecting an extravaganza and that's exactly what they're going to get.' However, before Gary can get back to the UK for tour rehearsals, he has the small matter of seeing his musical open on Broadway. And as he waited for the premiere to take place in New York on Wednesday, Gary admitted he was feeling equal parts nervous and excited. He said: 'It's felt like a little secret for so long and it felt like it was never ever going to happen. It feels quite weird to hand over our little baby and have everyone see it.' It was the new Late Late Show host James Corden who first put Gary in touch with Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein when he was looking for someone to write the score for his musical Finding Neverland. He'll be back: Gary told MailOnline that Jason (second left) is excited to come and see his former bandmates on their new tour . Speaking of James, Gary said: I feel like I'm going to owe him for the rest of my life and he's loving that at the moment. He's doing brilliant on The Late Late Show and if he'd have us we'd definitely go on and perform some songs from the musical.' Speaking about Hollywood supremo Harvey, Gary admitted he was surprised by how much creative control Weinstein gave him and co-writer Eliot Kennedy. 'He's someone that I'd heard about and I was really keen to meet him,' Gary told MailOnline. When he called me up I was definitely interested. 'I didn't know how he worked but now I realise he is a creative. He completely trusted our music. We've had an amazing couple of years.' And then there were three: Gary promised fans that they can expect an 'extravaganza' when they come to see the new tour . It's not goodbye:\u00a0Jason Orange shocked Take That fans around the world when he quit the chart-topping band last September but he hasn't said goodbye to them forever . While Gary had a taste of Hollywood when he performed songs from Finding Neverland at Harvey's pre-Oscars party, he insisted he will be sticking to writing and not asking Harvey to cast him in a new project. 'The last time I acted was on Heartbeat in 1998,' Gary said. 'Diane, the director of Neverland, always calls me JM Gary and says she is going to get me up on stage. 'I cannot act whatsoever, so I think I'm just going to stick to writing and singing.' 'He completely trusted our music': Gary revealed Hollywood mogul and Finding Neverland producer Harvey Weinstein has been extremely encouraging since bringing him on to write the music for the Broadway musical . Big night: On Wednesday Gary's Finding Neverland had its Broadway premiere . That's what friends are for:\u00a0It was the new Late Late Show host James Corden who first put Gary in touch with Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein when he was looking for someone to write the score for his musical . Meanwhile, Gary admitted he is dismayed by Louis Walsh's recent declaration that his X Factor days could be numbered and said he hopes the veteran judge doesn't leave. Barlow exclusively told MailOnline: 'I really hope he doesn't leave. To me he's the life of that show. He brings the silliness to it and that's what everyone loves. He's a big part of it behind the scenes too. I don't think they should lose him. I think what could happen is he might leave and then they'll get to auditions and send a plane for him.' Stronger than ever: Gary believes that Zayn Malik's (second left) departure from One Direction won't stop the band going on to even greater success . Just as Jason Orange's departure from Take That shocked fans, so too did Zayn Malik's recent decision to quit One Direction. But Gary believes the remaining members Niall Horan, Harry Styles, Liam Payne and Louis Tomlinson will come out it stronger than ever. Gary, who also saw Robbie Williams leave Take That in 1995, said: 'I think it's slightly easier for the band. You can lean on each other. I think it's always harder for the one who leaves. 'For One Direction it's just a transitional period. Like us their fans are very supportive.'

{"article":"A Mississippi Senator's personal assistant has been charged with trafficking drugs from China to use as payment for sexual favors. Police launched an investigation after seizing a package on April 9 with over a kilo of the date rape drug GBL addressed to  Fred Pagan, office manager and personal assistant to Sen. Thad Cochran (R-MS). Raiding his home on Thursday, they uncovered 181.5 grams of meth. Senator: Thad Cochran (R-MS) has yet to comment on the fact that his personal assistant and office manager Fred Pagan has been charged with trafficking drugs, including methamphetamine, from China . Pagan was paid $160,000 in his Senate role last year, the Washington Post reports. The paper states Pagan, 49, has worked for Cochran since he was 16 years old. He is charged with one count of possession and intent to distribute methamphetamine and one count of importing a controlled substance. The former is punishable by five to 40 years in prison, the latter by up to 20. Pagan was released on Friday after an initial court appearance. He will appear again on May 14. Court documents read by The Washington City Paper say Pagan admits he acquired three loads of drugs through a dealer. He is accused of buying the substances to exchange for sexual favors. Sen Cochran's spokesman Chris Gallegos confirmed a staff member had been arrested but refused to confirm further details. He told the City Paper: 'Our office is in the process of consulting with Senate legal counsel.' GBL, the drug Cochran allegedly acquired from a dealer in China, is similar to the date rape drug GHB. It is illegal to manufacture or sell either variant of the drug in the United States. Users can face two years in prison, suppliers up to 14 years. The drug, which is in liquid form, is packaged is select types of plastic as it is said to burn through many normal types of packaging.","highlights":"Fred Pagan, personal assistant to Sen Thad Cochran (R-MS), is charged with possession and intent to supply meth, plus trafficking drugs .\nPolice raided his home after seizing date rape drugs addressed to him .\nPagan is accused of intending to swap drugs for sexual favors .\nHe faces up to 40 years in prison, has been released until May court date .\nSen Cochran has yet to comment on the arrest .","id":"68f5033ef1c3c506793eaf8b4873b7217779df1b"}
{"article":"A man has made the infamous shepherds pie-trifle combination of custard, jam and meat immortalised in popular TV show Friends. On the show hapless character Rachel decided to treat her loved ones to what she mistakenly thought was 'a traditional English trifle' layered with all the trimmings - including\u00a0ladyfingers, jam, custard, beef saut\u00e9ed with peas and onions, a little more custard, bananas and some whipped cream. Now one brave Mancunian has whipped up their own version of the unusual concoction - replacing the beef with the far more traditional lamb. Scroll down for video . Neil Killham made the infamous shepherds pie-trifle combination immortalised on Friends 16 years ago. It features sponge, jam, custard, lamb, peas, onions, whipped cream and is garnished with sprinkles . Neil Killham, a 32-year-old software engineer from Manchester, announced his plans on Twitter with a picture of his clashing ingredients with the caption: 'It's finally time. I'm making The Trifle Out Of Friends.' Giving a running commentary on the social media site, Neil proudly showed off the finished masterpiece which actually looked very respectable - until he cut into it. He told his followers that while it does not taste like feet - as characters on the show claimed - it was still 'f****** horrible'. He added: 'But with enough nice trifle stuff that we keeping eating more of it.' The trifle-shepherds pie combination did not look quite as appetising once it had been sliced into . Friends character Rachel Green (played by Jennifer Aniston) accidentally made the disgusting dessert . Neil posted this picture of a friend attempting a second go at the trifle pie - it doesn't appear to have improved . 'I thought I'd be able to compartmentalise the clashing flavours, but I cannot.' When MailOnline asked how it tasted, Neil, who shared the dish with friends, said: 'It tasted terrible of course - but not so bad that I couldn't finish my slice. 'It's the way you sometimes think you've got lucky and got a nice pure trifle bite and then pow! Lamb!' He said in the last year he has made curry flavoured cupcakes, a chilli cheesecake and a pancake pizza, among other things. 'Usually they kind of work, so I figured it was time to try something that definitely wouldn't,' he said. 'Although when I tried sprouts in marmite that didn't work either, but it wasn't as bad as this. 'A couple of people tried it with me last night and agreed it was terrible.\u00a0Opinions were mixed on whether the lamb or the onion was the biggest problem. 'Then a couple of people at work also tried it and came to similar conclusions. 'Except for one guy who said \"it wasn't that bad really. Not good, but not the worst\". 'I'm not sure I can trust him any more.' The trifle looked distinctly unappetising when dished up on a plate - and apparently tasted even worse . In the show the dessert was described as half trifle, half shepherd's pie after two pages in the English cookery book Rachel was using stuck together - but the creators mistakenly used beef instead of the lamb which is traditional in the pie. Towards the end of the season six episode the penny finally drops and Rachel says: 'I wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle!' If for some reason you would like to recreate this Heston Blumenthal-esque clash of flavours and textures, the recipe would appear to be: A layer of sponge, layer of jam, layer of custard, layer of raspberries, another layer of sponge, layer of lamb saut\u00e9ed with peas and onions, a bit more custard, banana, and a topping of whipped cream garnished with hundreds and thousands .","highlights":"Friends fan Neil Killham recreated the infamous trifle-shepherds pie .\nCharacter\u00a0Rachel\u00a0accidentally\u00a0creates disgusting\u00a0concoction\u00a0in season 6 .\nDish includes sponge, jam, custard, lamb, peas, onions and whipped cream .\nNeil said finished product was 'terrible' but he managed to finish his slice .","id":"39facdaf3caaaf9a1bb37bc82cd98027824614bc"}

Hulk, who has 41 caps for Brazil, recently signed a new long-term deal at the Russian club until the end of the 2018-19 season. Zenit's No 7's previous deal, reportedly worth more than \u00a35million a year, had been due to expire in summer 2017. The club did not provide any financial details of the new contract - with the striker having netted 15 goals in 33 appearances for the Russian giants in all competitions at present. Hulk's new contract comes at a time when many Russian football clubs are struggling with financial problems because of the low value of the ruble, which has lost almost half of its value against the dollar in the last 12 months - with Rotor Volgograd going bankrupt earlier this month. Top players in Russia are typically paid in dollars or euros, but club budgets are in rubles, putting pressure on clubs' finances.

{"article":"Many couples disagree over what to name their children \u2014 but one New York couple\u2019s battle over their unborn baby\u2019s moniker became so unbearable that they have asked random members of the public to help them reach a decision. Kseniya Soukeras, who is due in August, wants to name her unborn child Michael, after her late father. Her husband Nicholas prefers the Greek name Spyridon, after his own father. Because they have been unable to settle their disagreement privately, the couple has turned to the general public to help them make a decision; Nicholas, 37, has launched an online petition\u00a0asking for help to sway his wife. Baby name showdown: Nicholas and Kseniya Soukeras\u00a0can't agree over whether to name their child Spyridon or Michael, which Nicholas says his wife will shorten to Mischa . 'The argument is serious \u2014 it\u2019s not a joke,' Kseniya, 33, told the\u00a0New York Post. 'I don\u2019t want to call my son something I can\u2019t even pronounce.' According to the petition, Kseniya finds the name Spyridon 'archaic, base, bereft of elegance and unsuitable for a child living in 21st century America'. But Nicholas argues that his wife simply has not had the opportunity to grow to like the name, and that her 'Russian ear is not trained for the sweet, musical sounds of our Greek nomenclature'. Rich history: Nicholas says the name Spyridon 'has been held by the highest and most honored officials and patriots of both the U.S. and the former Soviet Union' However, the nights of 'bickering about it back and forth' may be moot: the couple does not even know for sure whether they are even having a son. 'My husband is convinced. He thinks he\u2019s a psychic... he thinks he can see through the belly,' says Kseniya. In fact, if the couple has a girl, Nicholas is willing to let Kseniya choose the name; he also says that if they name their first born son Spyridon, his wife can choose the name of their second son. Mystery child: The couple doesn't yet know the sex of their baby; if it's a girl, Nicolas will surrender all naming rights to Kseniya . While they wait to find out, Nicholas is hoping to get 100,000 signatures supporting his choice\u00a0\u2014 the magic number that his wife agreed would be enough for him to get his way. 'I\u2019ll settle for 100,000 \u2014 this is an approximate population of my hometown Maladzyechna,' says Kseniya, who was born in Belarus. Nicholas is still far off from his goal, but his nuanced plea has so far garnered over 200 supporters.","highlights":"Nicholas Soukeras, 37, of Queens, New York wants his future son to be called Spyridon, after his father .\nHis wife, Kseniya, 33, doesn't like the 'archaic' name and prefers to call their child Michael .\nNicholas needs his online petition to earn 100,000 signatures for his wife to relent .\nIronically, the couple don\u2019t actually know for certain that they are having a boy .","id":"3e4b0bd8f208707de67f324573bbb95f269d0a33"}
{"article":"It was once the edgiest place in town, attracting the word's biggest bands to its iconic stage - but 30 years later Cleveland's Variety Theater is silent. The venue was renowned for its rock concerts but everything changed in 1984 when heavy metal band Motorhead played a gig so loud it literally began to bring the house down. As the crowd went wild over the group's unique ear-shattering brand of music, the ceiling cracked and pieces of plaster began to fall on the audience - ending the concert and the life of the Variety Theater in one deafening shriek. Abandoned for 30 years: The Variety Theater in Cleveland was once a buzzing music venue but was closed down after the ceiling cracked during a Motorhead gig in 1984 . The power was cut off to stop the band from playing and two years later a judge ordered the theater to be sealed off for good. Built in 1927, The Variety Theater was home to one of the earliest single screen cinemas in Cleveland, Ohio, before becoming an iconic music venue. The 20,000 sq ft main stage hosted the likes of  Metallica, the Dead Kennedy's and R.E.M. before Motorhead's fatal performance on December 2 1984. Since then it has stayed abandoned and hidden from public eye until now, thirty years later, a photographer has captured a collection of eery images offering a fascinating glimpse into music history. Seph Lawless, the 37-year-old photojournalist from Cleveland who took these incredible pictures, said: 'I'm Cleveland born and raised and I've always been into rock and roll.

Crumbling and rotting remains: The once-iconic Ohio venue was sealed off on the order of a judge in 1986, two years after Motorhead's gig . 'It was really inspiring to go in and photograph the theater, it's something I've always wanted to do and at times it actually felt like I was stepping back in time. 'I love rock and roll music so it was just incredible, it was like a time capsule to that era and that all the bands who performed there were captured in the fabric of the building.'

Margaret Bates, from Mottram, Tameside, said she is still unable to read the autopsy report detailing the 150 injuries her 17-year-old daughter Kelly-Anne suffered at the hands of her violent lover James Smith. Too traumatised to speak about her only daughter's death until now, Mrs Bates, 60, said she is consumed by one thought - that she wished she had killed Smith when she first met him. Margaret and Tommy Bates are speaking about their daughter Kelly-Anne's brutal murder for the first time . Kelly-Anne Bates enjoys time with her friends . Mrs Bates, who has two sons, Andrew, 39, and Paul, 33, said: 'I know I shouldn\u2019t say this, but I wish I\u2019d killed him the first time I saw him. That way Kelly would still be alive.' Over three barbaric weeks, Smith burnt Kelly-Anne with an iron, scalded her with boiling water and even gouged out her eyes. Smith also tied her to a radiator by her hair, broke her arm and knees and stabbed her all over her body with knives, forks and scissors, causing 150 separate injuries before beating her with a shower head and drowning her in the bath. Throughout the horrific onslaught, the terrified teenager was alive, begging for mercy. Smith, who was then 49, got life imprisonment and must serve a minimum of 25 years for his horrific crimes. Next year marks the 20th anniversary of Kelly-Anne's death, but Mrs Bates said even with the passage of time, she and her husband Tommy, 66, are unable to read the post-mortem report which details the injuries their daughter endured. Flashback: Kelly-Anne and her mother Margaret on holiday in Barry Island, Wales . 'Every now and again, I phone the coroner to ask for the post-mortem report but each time I back out. I can't face it - I never will,' she said. Mrs Bates said as a little girl, Kelly-Anne was a tomboy who loved playing football with her friends. She also adored children, and often babysat for neighbours. She said: 'Kelly loved children and wanted to be a teacher. She was soft-hearted and very maternal.' Sadistic killer James Smith . At 14, while babysitting for a friend, Kelly-Anne met James Smith. He began a grooming process which was so secretive that her parents knew nothing about him for two years. When Kelly-Anne was 15, she stayed out over night and her panicked parents called the police. When she finally came home, the following morning, she claimed to have stayed over with a schoolfriend called Rachel. Mrs Bates said: 'I knew she was lying. It wasn't like her, but I'd no idea what was going on. 'Kelly was a good girl. As well as babysitting, she had a job on a market stall at weekends. She played hockey and she was clever at school. She was hard-working and sensible and I could never have dreamed she was being groomed by a monster.' She said Kelly-Anne once arrived home with a black eye and told her parents she had been attacked by a gang of girls in the street. Soon afterwards, Kelly-Anne announced she had a new boyfriend, James Smith, who she said was 32 years old. 'The first time I met him, he swaggered down the stairs and it made the hairs stand up on the back of my neck,' said Mrs Bates. 'He was much older than I expected and this wasn\u2019t the man I wanted for my daughter. I vividly recall seeing our bread knife in the kitchen and wanting to pick it up and stab him in the back. 'It was a bizarre thought - I would never normally think of anything so violent and now I wonder whether it was some sort of sixth sense. 'I\u2019ve thought about that many times.'

She was very strong-minded and she wouldn\u2019t listen to me. And I was worried that, if I fell out with her, it would just push them closer together. 'One night she came home and her face was black and blue. Another time, her hand was bruised. I suspected Smith was hitting her, but Kelly-Anne denied it. 'I rang the police but they said there was nothing they could do without a statement from Kelly.' In November 1995, 17-year-old Kelly-Anne moved in with Smith who lived in Gorton, Manchester. Kelly-Anne gets to grips with crutches after injuring herself as a teenager . She spoke to her parents most weeks on the phone, when Smith was present, but never saw them again. Mrs Bates said: 'In addition to worrying about Kelly-Anne, our youngest son, Paul, was in hospital for weeks and I had a hernia operation too, so our lives were thrown into chaos. 'We even went round to Smith's address to try to persuade her to come home, but he was there all the time. The young Kelly-Anne smiles for the camera . 'On one visit he showed me a hole in his floor boards where he said he'd had a gas leak. 'Just a few weeks later, he kept Kelly prisoner in the hole while he tortured her.' Mrs Bates said she then discovered that Smith was 48 years old - 21 years older than Kelly-Anne. She said she pleaded with Kelly-Anne to leave him, but by now, Smith controlled all their contact. In the weeks before her death, Kelly-Anne endured unimaginable torture while her family - terrified of pushing her even further into Smith\u2019s clutches - waited by the phone. 'In April, I got a Mother's Day card from Kelly in Smith's handwriting and I'd had enough,' she said. 'But I was torn; I didn't want to keep going round there because I thought it was making things worse. 'It haunts me to think if we had gone round there she would be alive today.' Mrs Bates said she contacted the police domestic violence unit and was encouraged to give her daughter its leaflets. Tragically, Mrs Bates was never to see Kelly-Anne again and said she still has the leaflets to this day. On April 16, 1996, Mrs Bates said police arrived to tell them that Kelly-Anne was dead. Kelly-Anne had been starved and had lost more than three stone in weight. Loving tribute: A floral tribute bearing Kelly-Anne's name at her funeral, which took place the day before her 18th birthday . Her body was so badly mutilated that police and pathologists said it was the worst case of abuse they had ever seen. The jury at Smith's trial was offered counselling due to the horrific details of the case. Kelly-Anne was buried the day before her 18th birthday. Smith was jailed for life in November 1997 and during the trial it emerged that he had a horrific history of violence towards women. Mr and Mrs Bates have now set up a local branch of the national support group Support After Murder or Manslaughter (SAMM) for other parents and have found some comfort in helping other families. 'I wish I had killed Smith myself,' added Mrs Bates. 'I want him to die just like Kelly did. Not a day goes by when I don\u2019t think that. 'But he had her in his clutches and I couldn\u2019t save her.' Flowers, cards and messages are piled up on Kelly-Anne's grave .","highlights":"Margaret Bates is haunted by horrific murder of 17-year-old Kelly-Anne .\nMum-of-three says she can't read autopsy report which details 150 injuries .\nSpeaking for the first time after being left traumatised by death .\nTeen's boyfriend, James Smith, 49, was jailed for life after 1996 murder .\nJury offered counselling after hearing of the youth's unimaginable ordeal .","id":"3fdfee1af2e12ca0948c3f0b69c0a45a6811bf7b"}

{"article":"A passenger plane trying to land at a Texas airport turned back when the pilot discovered that the runway lights had been switched off. American Eagle Flight 2536 was scheduled to fly about 125 miles from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport to Wichita Falls, Texas, on Sunday night. The plane left nearly a half-hour late, and when it got to Wichita Falls, the pilot told passengers that the runway lights were turned off and there was nobody at the airport to turn them on, according to officials in the city of 100,000 people. Plane:\u00a0American Eagle Flight 2536 was scheduled to fly about 125 miles from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport to Wichita Falls, Texas, on Sunday night (file photo) Wichita Falls officials first said that the Eagle pilot had the wrong radio frequency to turn on the lights on the main, 13,000-foot runway. Like many other small airports where control towers are not staffed around the clock, pilots in Wichita Falls can operate the runway lights with their radio system. But on Tuesday, city aviation director John Burrus said that Sheppard Air Force Base, which shares the facility, had closed the runway and turned off the lights. Burrus said Sheppard notified pilots of the closure. He added that the American Eagle jet could have landed on an adjacent, 10,000-foot runway that was lit. A spokesman for ExpressJet, a regional carrier that operated the flight under contract with American Airlines, said late Tuesday that the airline was still trying to determine what happened. 'The pilot attempted to activate the lights, but he couldn't do so,' said Jarek Beem, the ExpressJet spokesman. He said he didn't know why the pilot didn't land on the shorter runway. 'We're still reviewing the entire incident.' Beem said the pilot circled Wichita Falls for about 30 minutes before giving up and turning back to DFW. The plane, with 45 passengers, made an otherwise uneventful midnight landing at DFW after a one hour, 40-minute flight, according to tracking service FlightAware.com.

{"article":"A woman who fractured her neighbour's skull with a hammer during a street fight as part of an eight-year feud has been jailed. Lisa Williams, 49, hit taxi driver David Coleman three times after finding the\u00a054-year-old brawling with her brother in the street, a court heard. The two families had been 'neighbours at war' since the Colemans moved in next door to the Williams family on St Catherine\u2019s Road, Chingford, in 2007. Lisa Williams (pictured leaving court, left) hit taxi driver David Coleman (right) three times with the hammer during a street fight . On the morning of the attack, the court heard that William's sibling Jonathan\u00a0had smeared mud all over the Coleman's front bay windows. When the victim went to confront him, they got into a fight. James Benson, prosecuting, said: \u2018Mr Coleman is not a small man but fairly well built, Jonathan Williams is bigger built still and is in fact a younger man than Mr Coleman,\u2019 he said. \u2018Between the two of them punches were thrown by both parties, this was before Lisa Williams had anything to do with the incident. \u2018Ultimately the parties say Mr Williams gained the upper hand in the fight as the bigger and younger man, and both me went to the ground.\u2019 At that point the bigger man allegedly straddled Mr Coleman as Williams emerged from their house holding a claw hammer, she then struck him three times to the head. She was only stopped when a third neighbour Bernard Mason, pulled the hammer out of her hands, and his wife Pamela was forced to sit on the her until the police arrived. Williams admitted striking Mr Coleman with a hammer, but claimed she believed he was about to kill her brother and she acted out of panic. Warring neighbours: The two families were described as \u2018neighbours at war\u2019 after\u00a0the Colemans (left) moved in next door to the Williams' home (right) Before fetching the hammer she called 999 from  house she shared with her brother and mother, who can be heard screaming \u2018leave him alone, leave him alone\u2019 in the background. Williams was convicted of unlawfully wounding Mr Coleman after a trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court in February. Mr Benson described the two families as \u2018neighbours at war\u2019. The victim told the court that the Williams family had an irrational hatred of him. He claimed they would throw dog faeces over their garden fence and let their pet bark all hours of the day. Mr Coleman also believed they would be deliberately noisy and bang on the walls in the morning so he couldn't sleep after a night shift. However, Recorder Richard Sutton told the family \u2018it takes two to Tango\u2019. In a victim impact statement, Mr Coleman said he still suffers headaches and anxiety as a result of the attack, and often has to take days off work as a result. Isobel McCarroll, for Williams, said: \u2018On the day in questions they were doing home improvements, her brother was out the front and she was doing some gardening, the hammer was in the hallway. \u2018She came across an incident that was in full swing, she was nothing to do with the initial fighting - she came across something that must have been a terrifying scene and she rang 999 first.\u2019 Williams, 49, was jailed for 30 months today at Snaresbrook Crown Court in London (pictured) after she was found guilty of maliciously wounding Mr Coleman . \u2018She then went and tried to split the parties up, she went back in and she didn\u2019t know if she was going to call 999 again and when she was in she saw the hammer - it might go a considerable way to mitigating the actions that followed. \u2018It was three blows in quick succession and thankfully it was stopped by Mr Mason.\u2019 She said Williams, who has no previous convictions, has been living apart from her family for two years since the incident and the family are now selling their home on St Catherine\u2019s Road. Jailing Williams for two years and six months, the judge said: \u2018You find yourself in a very, very sad situation as you no doubt appreciate, and it has come about because of the situation that has evolved between you and your neighbours. \u2018This in my view was an incident waiting to happen and it was going to be serious and both sides were quite prepared for confrontation as and when it arose. \u2018That\u2019s the problem if it becomes violent, you never quite know where it is going to end - I understand that you thought the only way to respond to what was taking place was to arm yourself and it\u2019s that action that the law finds unallowable and therefore criminal. \u2018I accept that there was a substantial amount of provocation\u2019. Williams was also barred from contacting the Coleman family indefinitely and ordered to pay a \u00a3120 surcharge.","highlights":"Lisa Williams hit neighbour\u00a0David Coleman with a hammer three times .\nThe families had been 'at war' since the Colemans moved in next door .\nVictim - who suffered a\u00a0fractured\u00a0skull - was\u00a0brawling with Williams' brother .\nShe was handed a restraining order and sentenced to 30 months in jail .","id":"94de03c9978343e27f8ee62471961295391ac748"}
{"article":"Racing legend Tony McCoy ended his career as a jump jockey without adding to his haul of more than 4,300 winners. His two, third-place finishes at Sandown Park in front of a packed crowd of 18,000 race fans brought an end to the greatest racing career in history. McCoy, 40, has been champion jump jockey for the past 20 years, and when he was handed the trophy for the final time today by former Arsenal player Ian Wright, it emerged that the Irish jockey will be allowed to keep it in perpetuity. An emotional Tony McCoy takes a moment after he finished third in his 17,630th race at Sandown Park . Some 18,000 people packed Sandown Park to see the 20-time Champion Jockey on his final two rides . McCoy was joined on stage by his wife Chanelle and daughter Eve and young son Archie . McCoy, known to racing fans as AP, was cheered on by his wife Chanelle, and children Archie and Eve. In a career that has lasted more than 25 years, McCoy has ridden in more than 17,000 races and fallen an estimated 1,000 times breaking almost every bone in his body at least once. McCoy looked clearly emotional has he waved to the crowd after finishing third aboard Box Office in his final race. The record-breaking jockey admitted that, unusually, he had difficulty sleeping last night before his final professional rides. McCoy has been Champion Jockey in Britain and Ireland since 1996. During his career he has had 4,348 winners since his first victory in in Thurles, in Tipperary, Ireland on March 26, 1992 aboard Legal Steps. His first British winner was in Exeter in 1994, riding Chickabiddy to victory. AP McCoy was reduced to tears as he competed as a professional jockey for the last-ever time on Saturday . An emotional McCoy couldn't contain his emotions as he waved to the crowd after his last race . McCoy was congratulated by fellow jockeys as he prepared for his final ever race after in Sandown Park . Speaking to Channel 4, McCoy said: 'Today has been way beyond my expectations and thanks to Sandown and all the people who have been here today. It\u2019s been an honour and a privilege. I\u2019ve had a brilliant way of life for the past 25 years. 'I think it\u2019s so much easier to enjoy and be successful in what you do if you like the people you work with and I\u2019ve been incredibly lucky in that respect.' After the race, he was joined on stage by his family where he addressed the crowd. 'I would like to thank the BHA for allowing me to keep the trophy. I have had it a long time. 'I don't think I will ever celebrate retirement. I feel more sadness but I aware it had to happen It felt very different driving in and going into the Weighing Room. 'I went into the sauna for three-quarters of an hour and I will probably never go into one in my life again. 'There has been the last time this and the last time that over the last few weeks but this really is the last time. Last night was probably the first time in my life I didn't sleep well. My routine is going to have to change so much I will have to adapt.' McCoy announced his retirement in February but it was only the passing of the Grand National and his last rides at Cheltenham that made reality hit home. The racing legend was swamped by photographers and punters following his last professional race . McCoy was presented the Champion Jockey trophy by Ian Wright - McCoy is an Arsenal fanatic . McCoy added: 'Race riding has been an addiction. The reason in the last two weeks I have not been riding as much was because I wanted to get myself prepared. 'That is why I announced my retirement when I did. I wanted to prepare myself for not being a jockey. 'I thought that was the best way of coping with it. It has been easy until the last couple of weeks. I am well aware the next two days , two weeks, two months, two years are going to be the most difficult.' 'I have been very lucky and what I would say to the young lads in the weighing room enjoy every moment of it. 'In any sport to be successful you have to be prepared to work harder than anyone else. I think I have got talent but I have never thought I am the best at anything. When I look back I don't think I leave much behind.' In his final race, he was beaten by his long-time rival and friend Richard Johnson - who has been runner-up in the Champion Jockey race to McCoy for the past fifteen years. Speaking after the race, McCoy tipped his friend to take over from him next season. 'I\u2019d like Richard Johnson to be Champion Jockey because he made me achieve a lot of the things that I did. 'I would never have achieved the numbers I have done if it wasn\u2019t for Richard Johnson. That\u2019s no disrespect to Sam Twiston-Davies or Tom Scudamore or Jason Maguire. We have numerous lads who could be Champion Jockey, but personally I would like Richard Johnson to be Champion Jockey.' In advance of his final rides today, stars from across sport, entertainment and racing paid tribute to McCoy, among them, Arsene Wenger, manager of his beloved Arsenal. The Arsenal boss said: 'I would like to congratulate you AP on your outstanding career. It\u2019s absolutely exceptional what you have done and at Arsenal, who we know you support, we are inspired by that kind of dedication, quality and consistency that you have achieved in your career. Well done.' Presenter Clare Balding said: 'I admire him so much for his skill in the saddle, for his dedication to the sport, for being able to stay at the top of his game for 20 years. 'But I almost admire him more for turning away now, for being able to bow out at the top, I think that takes so much courage. He knows he could carry on for another five years but he doesn\u2019t want to doubt himself. 'He knows that if he doubts himself for a second that will travel down the reigns and the horses won\u2019t believe what he\u2019s always believed, that he is the best.' Sandown Park was packed with fans eager to watch McCoy in his penultimate race on Saturday . The retiring 20-time champion jockey admitted he went into the final two rides of his career with a heavy heart . Retiring jockey McCoy insists he will never return to professional racing after his Sandown farewell . Dame Judi Dench, Actress: 'A winner. He\u2019s a winner. I can\u2019t imagine how he is going to feel, I must say, retiring from having such a kind of glittering career. He was born to ride a horse, he was born to win too. It\u2019s wonderful to meet him and be able to say to him, you\u2019re a legend.' Ian Wright, who presented the Champions Jockey trophy McCoy said: 'AP McCoy is made of something else altogether. For 20 years he has been at the top of his game, riding winners, week in week out. I can think of no other sportsman or woman who can match his record. Like the Arsenal team of 2003\/04 he\u2019s proven that he truly is an Invincible. It was an incredible honour to award him with his trophy for the final time on the day he retires.' Trainer Jonjo O\u2019Neill, who : 'He\u2019s a brilliant all-rounder. He was the one man out there you didn\u2019t want riding against you. I was lucky to get a lot of use out of him \u2013 more than anybody else. He\u2019s fantastic on the lesser horses and he gets just as much of a kick out of winning a selling plate race as he does the Gold Cup. He gives it the same ride, that\u2019s why he\u2019s very special.' JP McManus, Racehorse Owner and long-standing employer: 'I get enormous pleasure from AP riding. If he is on one of my horses then it\u2019s a bonus but if it\u2019s somebody else\u2019s I still get a thrill out of it. We\u2019ve had many great days winning the Grand National and a Gold Cup. There\u2019s never a right time [to retire], but it\u2019s nice that he\u2019s picking a time of his choosing. He\u2019s an ironman and a lovely man. I\u2019ve grown to love him more and more, as my family have. There\u2019s something deep and great about him.' Tony McCoy signs autographs for punters on his final-ever day as a jockey at Sandown .

However, the midfielder has once again not been fined after the Liverpool boss spoke to him as well as Ibe on Thursday and the club insist the case is now closed. Brendan Rodgers has met with Sterling to remind him of his professional responsibilities at Liverpool . Rodgers and Sterling were locked in discussions at the Melwood training ground on Friday . Liverpool players Raheem Sterling and Jordon Ibe have been pictured holding a shisha pipe . This is the second time Sterling has been pictured with a shisha pipe in the last week . Jordon Ibe has also been warned by Rodgers after the youngster was pictured alongside Sterling . Sterling, 20, and Ibe, 19, were pictured during what is believed to be a visit to a shisha cafe in London earlier this season. Sterling met Liverpool manager Rodgers and he was reminded of his professional responsibilities and warned about the consequences of taking a drug that has been called \u2018hippy crack\u2019. It has been a controversial week for Sterling, who has 14 caps for England, all coming in the wake of his interview with the BBC in which he revealed why he had rejected a \u00a3100,000-a-week deal at Liverpool. Several clubs, including Arsenal, have withdrawn their interest in the midfielder in the light of recent images. Sterling is all smiles during training as he completes a sprinting drill alongside Philippe Coutinho . It appears that Sterling and Ibe each have a shisha pipe and are also drinking Fanta . Sterling was pictured on social media smoking a shisha pipe in a story published over the weekend . Sterling was also filmed apparently inhaling nitrous oxide - known as 'hippy crack' Rodgers questioned Sterling\u2019s professionalism on Monday after footage emerged of the 20-year-old unconscious in his house in Southport having taken nitrous oxide with two unnamed friends, but has yet to speak publicly about the pictures with Ibe.

{"article":"I yield to no one in my love of the old days \u2014 warm beer, cricket on the village green, bobbies on bicycles two by two, all that \u2014 but it's rare a chance arises to compare the rose-tinted past with the brave new world, as it did on Saturday evening when Sky's high-octane Premier League coverage went head-to-head with Arsenal v Reading in the FA Cup semi-final on the BBC. As we know, the Premier League has the money and prestige, but what the FA Cup has is history, and boy does the BBC love a bit of history? Lest you were in any doubt, its coverage of the semi-final kicked off with footage of the late Sir Laurence Olivier doing the St Crispin's Day speech from the film of Henry V ('We happy few, We band of brothers,' and so on). Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer, Jason Roberts and Ian Wright fronted the BBC's coverage at Wembley . BBC presenter Lineker prepares to present the Match of the Day 50th anniversary special broadcast .

Gunners forward Alexis Sanchez celebrates after scoring his side's winning goal in the FA Cup semi-final . Stand-in Match of the Day presenter Gabby Logan (left) with pundits Phil Neville and Robbie Savage (right) The excuse, I guess, was that Reading's nickname is the Royals, but as the second-tier team are also known as the Biscuitmen. The BBC even gave us a moment of history at half-time with a breakdown, something that used to be a regular feature of TV outside broadcasts, when a feature on Crystal Palace's shock semi-final victory over Liverpool 25 years ago came to a shuddering halt halfway through. In such instances, the BBC is lucky to retain the services of Gary Lineker, the best presenter of live football on TV. Sky have never really replaced the disgraced Richard Keys, who had the benefit of longevity in the post. The BBC needs to fight hard to avoid Lineker falling into the hands of rivals. Not that Sky's presenters are less than competent \u2014 David Jones did the job \u2014 but it's never a good sign when you have to go to Google to check which one it is. The price of live Premier League football is now way beyond the reach of the BBC, which may be the clincher in Lineker's future. While the BBC's match had the lion's share of the goalmouth action, it was difficult to resist turning over to Sky on occasion. Having invested its billions in the Premier League, Sky doesn't skimp on the peripheries. The sound always seems a little crisper, and in punditry, where Sky offers us the Rolls Royce of analysts, Gary Neville, the BBC counters with the mid-range Danny Murphy. In the commentary box, Sky fields Martin Tyler for its big games in the knowledge he'll rarely make a bad call, while the BBC never seems sure who its best commentator is.

{"article":"Radar images from Europe's Sentinel-1a satellite have revealed the aftermath of the Nepal earthquake in unrivalled detail. The information from the satellites has been transformed into an interferogram, which provides a colourful and highly detailed view of the Earth's land mass. By comparing before and after images, scientists have discovered Mount Everest shrank by about one inch due to the land that was shaken in the natural disaster. The tallest point in the world, however, still stands at 29,029 feet, according to The Weather Channel. Additionally, an area 75 miles (120km) by 30 miles (50km) has lifted up 3.2ft (1 metre) from the ground around the capital, Kathmandu. Interferogram over Kathmandu, Nepal, generated from two Sentinel-1A scans on 17 and 29 April 2015 \u2013 before and after the 25 April earthquake. Each \u2018fringe\u2019 of colour represents about 3cm of deformation. The large amount of fringes indicates a large deformation pattern of 3.2ft (1 metre) from the ground around Kathmandu . Scene: A rescue chopper prepares to land, evacuating climbers from higher camps to Everest Base Camp, Nepal. New radar images have shown that Mount Everest shrank one inch following the Nepal earthquake this week . These are the first radar images to reveal the destruction caused by the 7-magnitude earthquake that killed 5,000 people and affected millions more. 'There's a peak of slip just to the northeast of Kathmandu,' Professor Tim Wright from the Natural Environment Research Council told the BBC. He explained that what scientists count are the coloured 'fringes' in the interferogram, of which there are about 34 from this quake. This translates to more than 3.2ft (1 metre) of uplift. To the north of Kathmandu, the interferogram suggests that the ground receded, and it also shows how a fault ruptured east from the epicentre, but did not break the surface. Combining two Sentinel-1A radar scans from 17 and 29 April 2015, this interferogram shows changes on the ground that occurred during the 25 April earthquake that struck Nepal. An overall area of 120x100 km has moved \u2013 half of that uplifted and the other half, north of Kathmandu subsided. Vertical accuracy is a few centimetres . Sentinel-1A interferogram over Kathmandu, Nepal, showing deformation induced by the 25 April 2015 earthquake. East\u2013west \u2018fringes\u2019 cross the city, with each coloured fringe corresponding to 2.8 cm of ground displacement (both uplift and subsidence). The interferogram combines two Sentinel-1A images from 17 and 29 April 2015 . Launch: 3 April 2014 \u00a0French Guiana . Life: Minimum of seven years . Mass: 2300 kg (5070 lbs) Dimensions: 9.2ft (2.8m) long, 8.2ft (2.5m) wide, 13ft (4m) high . Mission: Monitoring sea ice, oil spills, winds and waves, land-use change and to respond to emergencies such as floods and earthquakes . How it works: Radar works by sending out radio waves and timing how long it takes for them to reflect back. The satellite uses a technique called 'Synthetic aperture radar interferometry'. Two or more satellite radar images of the same area are combined to detect large-scale changes. Small changes on the ground modify the reflected radar signal and lead to rainbow-coloured fringes in the 'interferogram'. Professor Wright says this suggests not all the strain in the rocks before the earthquake was released in during the catastrophic event. Sentinel-1A's swath width of 155 miles (250km) over land surfaces has allowed for an unprecedented area size to be analysed from a single scan. Scientists say the entire area will be covered under the same geometry every 12 days, allowing for the wider region to be regularly monitored for changes in the land. Its ability to 'see' through cloud and rain and in pitch darkness make it particularly useful for monitoring earthquakes and for offering images for emergency response. This is because it uses radar which works by sending out radio waves and timing how long it takes for them to reflect back. Radio waves travel through air virtually unimpeded, but materials like metal, rock and water act almost as mirrors which can help reveal those areas inundated by floods. It also makes no different to radar if the Earth is in darkness. Sentinel-1A is the first satellite for the Copernicus environment-monitoring programme led by the European Commission. The Copernicus EMS was activated on the day the earthquake struck, prompting Esa to begin collecting satellite imagery, which is being made available to support relief efforts. In parallel, the International Charter Space and Major Disasters was activated by India, China and the UN. Meanwhile, Nasa has posted its own images of the earthquake providing much less detail due to cloud cover. 'While we regularly post imagery of natural hazards, the weather and the satellites haven't cooperated in this case,' the space agency wrote in a blog. 'The orbital track of the satellites and the specific capabilities of the sensors on board determine whether we have imagery to share. In the case of Nepal, things haven't lined up in our favour.' The satellite imagery is used to create maps to support relief efforts, such as this \u2018grading map\u2019 of Kathmandu showing topographic features and crisis information. The red squares show road blockss, the green people markers show crowds, red dots are areas that are destroyed and yellow dots are areas that are possibly affected. The yellow lines mark out primary roads in the area . Sentinel-1 carries a radar that works in several specialised modes to provide detailed imagery (artist's impression left). The data will be used for applications such as monitoring the oceans, including shipping lanes, sea ice and oil spills. It also provides data to map changing land cover and deformations such as those produced by Saturday's devastating Earthquake in Nepal (right) Mount Everest before and after the earthquake. Not much change is visible because of a fresh coat of snow and cloud cover. The April 23 image was acquired by the Operational Land Imager on Landsat 8 .

{"article":"A mother-of-two has been jailed after stealing almost \u00a380,000 from her dying\u00a0parents to go on shopping sprees - leaving her elderly father in debt and too poor to afford a telephone. Christine Lillico, 47, from  Heddon-on-the-Wall, Northumberland, was trusted with looking after\u00a0her elderly parents' bank accounts as their health deteriorated with age. But instead of using the money to care for John and Audrey Air she plundered their life savings to bankroll her own lifestyle. Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) heard mother-of-two Christine Lillico, 47 was supposed to look after her elderly parents' bank accounts - but instead stole almost \u00a380,000 from them over a six year period . By the time her fraud was discovered Lillico had stolen a total of \u00a378,000. Newcastle Crown Court heard in the last months of his life Mr Air\u00a0went without a telephone and basic amenities, while suffering the shame of\u00a0being in debt for the first time in his life because of his daughter's crimes. A judge has now sent Lillico to jail and ordered she pay her brother John\u00a0Air junior \u00a339,000 - which would have been his inheritance has she not\u00a0stolen it. Sentencing her to 20 months behind bars, Mr Recorder Baird\u00a0said: 'You were trusted by your parents to look after them in their elderly\u00a0years. 'They had modest savings which had taken all their lives to\u00a0accumulate through hard work. 'Over a period of six years you plundered those savings. 'The result of\u00a0that was when your father died in 2014 he was in debt, something he had\u00a0never been in before and that is something that caused him great distress.' The court heard Lillico spent some of the \u00a378,000 on shopping sprees in B&Q (file image) Christopher Knox, prosecuting, explained how Mr and Mrs Air, from\u00a0Ashington, had both worked in the coal industry and had pensions. The couple gave their daughter control of their bank accounts after they sold their home for \u00a395,000 and moved in to a sheltered flat, as their\u00a0health began to fail as they grew older. 'The couple lived very sensibly,' said Mr Knox. 'By 2008 there was at least\u00a0\u00a355,000 in a savings account.' The court heard Mrs Air, who had suffered from dementia, passed away in October 2010 and\u00a0Mr Air died in July 2014. But the court heard Lillico had\u00a0been raiding her parents' accounts since 2008. Debit card transactions were made at various shops including JD Sports and B&Q. The accounts had also been used to pay for photography services\u00a0and to buy an XBox and cash was also withdrawn from the banks and cheques written. The court heard Lillico is of previous good character.\u00a0She pleaded guilty to three charges\u00a0of fraud. It was calculated the amount of money Lillico stole amounted to what\u00a0she and her brother would have inherited between them. The judge made an order under the Proceeds of Crime Act that she repay\u00a0the half she owes within six months. Nigel Hedley, defending, said Lillico was hit by financial problems after a\u00a0difficult divorce. 'She was a woman of good character. She had a very traumatic divorce and\u00a0encountered severe financial difficulties.' He also said Lillico had been suspended from her job as a medical secretary\u00a0as a result of her crimes, but that she would be able to pay her brother\u00a0the money she owed by re-mortgaging her house.","highlights":"Christine Lillico, 47, stole almost \u00a380,000 from her parents over six years .\nFrail father left so poor before his death he was forced to go without phone .\nShe spent the money on Xbox, shopping sprees and photography services .\nLillico has now been jailed for 20 months after pleading guilty to fraud .","id":"4e9dabb9b0f2722aef672f917bb4a5268dba7765"}

Karlis Bardelis, 30, from Latvia, was attempting to scale the cliff in Coire an Lochain, Scotland, when the accident happened. And footage from a camera mounted to his helmet shows the very second that his climbing axe came loose. Mr Berdalis said: 'I was just thinking \"I hope I land somewhere soft and don't break any bones\".' Scroll down for video .

You see his feet literally above his head as he continues to fall down the mountain head-first . Karlis Bardelis, left, and Gary Kinsey, right, on Headhunter's summit on January 28, 2012. Bardelis has only just released the footage of his terrifying fall on a training exercise in hospital . Between 0.12 and 0.20 seconds in the video below, you can see the axe slipping out of the ice and knocking his other axe out of position. Almost immediately his feet were in the air and Karlis can see nothing but his boots and the blue sky as he begins the terrifying fall down the 60m mountain. He continues to fall for three-and-a-half seconds until he's eventually saved by his safety rope after falling ten metres. But the experienced Latvian climber, who now works in Nepal, held his nerve after the tumble and even continued his ascent to the top. Bardelis scaling the mountain which he fell from. On the left you can see the safety rope that saved his life . Holding his nerve: The experienced climber grips the rock face on his ascent . He said: 'My ropes saved me and stopped my fall. 'These kind of falls are very dangerous because I'm carrying two ice tools and crampons, both of which are really sharp and could cause serious injuries. 'Obviously there's the risk of hitting a rock on my way down, which can cause serious fractures. 'I never think that I'm going to die in these situations - I never consider death as an option' Karlis had travelled to Scotland to take part in a training course organised by the British Mountaineering Council joining climbers from 26 countries. And he attempted the level six climb with some trepidation. Life on the line: Bardelis was rescued by his safety rope after his axe became dislodged from the ice, knocking the other out of position and sending him plunging down the mountain . He said: 'I was feeling excited about that climb but at the same time I was feeling scared in those difficult parts too. 'I fell because I made a mistake; I put one ice axe in a crack and was trying to put another one in but the placement wasn't good so it ripped the other one out. 'My crampons weren't in a stable place so I fell.' The footage shows Karlis tumble backwards from the cliff face and free fall towards the ground. Incredibly, after being saved by his harness, Karlis continued his ascent after the fall. He said: 'I climbed back to the same place and this time did it right using the same technique. 'Some people laugh when they see the video - others say they are not going to sleep after seeing it. 'I guess it was a good example of how not to climb.'

{"article":"A man vying to become the next Kentucky governor has legally changed his name to Gatewood Galbraith after a late local celebrity who bid five times for the title but never won enough votes. The 68-year-old Pulaski County resident, who was known as Terrill Wayne Newman until Tuesday, told the\u00a0Lexington Herald-Leader\u00a0he doesn't expect to be elected but hopes the gesture will 'warm Galbraith's grave.' His predecessor, who died in 2012 from chronic emphysema,\u00a0gained a following for his wit, sharp dress sense and support of legalizing marijuana. Terrill Wayne Newman (right), who is vying to become Governor of Kentucky, has legally changed his name to Gatewood Galbraith after the late local celebrity (left) who bid five times for the title but never won . The newly-christened Galbraith filed paperwork on Wednesday to run as an independent for the state's highest office. The Secretary of State's office says independent candidates must obtain 5,000 signatures from registered voters by August 11 to get their names on the general election ballot. Galbraith said he'll run on a similar platform, but will focus on his namesake. 'I mostly will be talking about the great Gatewood Galbraith,' he said. Galbraith says he and the late Galbraith were 'not friends per se,' but they shared mutual friends and knew each other on a first-name basis. Dea Riley, who was the original Galbraith's running mate in 2011, said she thinks he would find the whole name change amusing. 'I can hear him now: \"I'll tell the IRS to send him the tax bill,\"' Riley said. But she also said the new Galbraith\u00a0'has very big shoes to fill' with his name and she hopes he will honor it. 'To have Gatewood's name and message prostituted, for the sake to garner political office, is a personal affront to me in that I was not only his running mate but equally his friend and confidant,' Riley said.","highlights":"Terrill Wayne Newman is vying to become the next Kentucky\u00a0governor .\nOn Tuesday he legally changed his name to Gatewood Galbraith after a late local celebrity who bid five times for the title but never won enough votes .\nNewman says he doesn't expect to be elected but hopes the gesture will 'warm Galbraith's grave'","id":"8af1ef57fd3898d1e4e3e57ec49b5ea40ee2aa6c"}
{"article":"Masters champion Jordan Spieth is back to work this week at the RBC Heritage Classic after two days celebrating his victory at Augusta National and being showered with attention. Spieth arrived at Sea Pines Resort late Tuesday night after a media whirlwind in New York since tying Tiger Woods' Masters record of 18-under 270 to capture the green jacket. The 21-year-old said it was a dizzying stretch with 26 appearances and interviews in 25 hours. 'It was a little crazy in New York having paparazzi know where we were going to eat dinner even though we never told anybody,' Spieth said Wednesday. Spieth doesn't believe the success will change him. In fact, he said he upheld his commitment to the RBC Heritage in part to chase down Rory McIlroy for world No. 1. 'I wouldn't come to a tournament just to come to a tournament, especially with that goal still in mind,' said Spieth, who moved to No. 2 in the world rankings with the Masters' win. Jordan Spieth returns to golf just days after winning the Masters and will play in the RBC Heritage Classic . Spieth has had two victories and two runner-up finishes in his past four events. He would have liked to have had his normal pre-tournament preparations at Harbour Town Golf Links. Instead, he'll go into his first-round tee time Thursday not having played a hole of practice on the tricky, Pete Dye-designed layout. 'I'm sure Jordan's wiped,' said Kevin Streelman, the Par-3 contest winner at Augusta National last week who finished tied for 12th behind Spieth. 'But he's 21 years old, he can handle it.' Spieth has had success here the previous two years, finishing ninth in 2013 and 12th last year. The RBC Heritage gave him an invite two years ago when Spieth was a rising, yet largely unknown 19 -year-old trying to make his way on tour. The top-10 finish, Spieth said, helped his confidence and status on the PGA Tour. 'This tournament helped with job security,' Spieth said. 'So it's a tournament that's close to me and I love it here.' The 21-year-old was in formidable form at Augusta and equaled Tiger Woods' tournament birdie record . Most Masters champions - and many of the game's best players - take the next week off after a pressure-packed week at Augusta National. Spieth heads a group of five ranked in the top 20 of the world (No. 10 Jim Furyk, No. 14 Patrick Reed, No. 17 Matt Kuchar and No. 19 Billy Horschel are the others) to compete this week. Streelman enjoys playing right after a major, knowing his game is honed in and peaking after a Grand Slam event. 'Your game is really primed and amped up,' he said. 'I'm very prepared.' Kuchar is the tournament's defending champion, holing out from a green-side bunker on the 72nd hole to defeat Luke Donald by a stroke. Spieth's success has him atop the FedEx Cup standings, the youngest player ever to lead that category. Spieth celebrates after putting the winning hole and winning the Masters at such a young age . There have only been two Masters winners the past 15 years to follow up their victories by playing Harbour Town. Vijay Singh tied for third here in 2000 a week after winning the Masters while Zach Johnson was sixth in 2007. Only Bernhard Langer is 1985 followed a Masters victory with a triumph a week later at the RBC Heritage. Spieth believes he'll be the same driven, focused competitor he's always been after winning the major he dreamed of as a child. That might be difficult after this week's spotlight. Spieth got congratulatory Tweets from stars like Oklahoma City's Kevin Durant and about 200 texts and emails since the victory. 'Given some time, that will subside a little bit,' he said. What won't ease up, Spieth said, is his desire to achieve the very best in golf, a quest that continues at Harbour Town. 'I was very much looking forward to getting back here, getting on solid ground and taking a deep breath,' Spieth said. 'I'm really looking forward to this week.'","highlights":"Jordan Speith poised to play in the RBC Heritage Classic, South Carolina .\nThe 21-year-old won the Masters in record-breaking style at the weekend .\nSpieth doesn't want to rest on his laurels and plans to catch Rory McIlroy .","id":"63633d687315386f709769964145b8eae3b97893"}

Speaking in the documentary Jason Robinson: Sports Life Stories, which will be broadcast on ITV4 at 10pm on Tuesday, the 40-year-old former dual-code international admitted he had been a heavy drinker during his early days at rugby league club Wigan, which almost led to his downfall. Robinson, who scored for England in the 2003 World Cup final victory against Australia, said: 'I got into a situation where I was drinking sometimes six nights a week.

'I can remember I just sat in my bedroom with an old knife, an old meat cleaver,' he recalled. 'I didn't want life to go on in this way. That night when I contemplated doing it, I wept like a baby.

Robinson, pictured with Ben Cohen, has said 'nothing will compare to winning the World Cup in Australia' Robinson, who enjoyed immense success before switching codes in 2000, also looks back on England's World Cup win as the pinnacle of his 20-year playing career. 'When you look at the emotion on those players' faces, it was the reality and the relief that we have just won a World Cup,' he said. 'And I will never forget that. Jumping on Will Greenwood's back. Hugging Lawrence Dallaglio. All the hard work. Everything we've done has been for this moment.

{"article":"Veterinarians have criticised EU rules on organic farming that demands that fish are treated with homoeopathic remedies. In line with EU regulations, the first line of treatment for organic fish should be 'substances from plants, animals or minerals in a homeopathic dilution', before . British and Norwegian vets have called the directives 'scientifically illiterate', saying that the use of homeopathy could lead to 'serious animal health and welfare detriment.' 'Risk': Under EU regulations, organic farmers must first use 'substances from plants, animals or minerals in a homeopathic dilution' to treat ill fish, which has been criticised by British and Norwegian vets (stock image) The directives, outlined in the 2009 European regulation on organic aquaculture, are set to be brought into national law in non-EU Norway, which has caused vets to see red. Section 7 of the regulations calls for organic farmers to use 'substances from plants, animals or minerals in a homoeopathic dilution', as their first port of call when their fish are ill . After this, the 'veterinary treatments' section outlines that farmers may use  'plants and their extracts not having anaesthetic effects'. As well as the directive to use homeopathic treatments, organic fish farmers are only allowed to resort to mainstream medical treatments a maximum of twice per year, or their fish will lose its organic certification. This has been criticised by the \u00a0Norwegian Veterinary Association (NVA) as could mean that fish are not getting the correct treatment in time, causing them unnecessary suffering. Danger: British and Norwegian vets have called the EU directives on organic fish treatment 'scientifically illiterate', saying that the use of homeopathy could lead to 'serious animal health and welfare detriment' 'We think it's totally unacceptable from a scientific point of view because there's no scientific basis for using homeopathy,' Ellef Blakstad, the head of the Norwegian Veterinary Association, told The Local.no. 'If you start using homeopathy, you prolong the time when the animals are not getting adequate treatment and that's a threat to animal welfare.' Harsh: Farmers are only allowed to use mainstream medical treatments a twice per year, or their fish will lose its organic certification (stock image) The criticism from Norway has been echoed by the British Veterinary Association, saying use of homeopathy could lead to 'serious animal health and welfare detriment.' The British Veterinary Association (BVA) cannot endorse the use of homeopathic remedies, or indeed any products, making therapeutic claims, which have no proven efficacy,' British Veterinary Association President John Blackwell told MailOnline. 'As with any treatment for disease using medicines, BVA believes that veterinary medicinal products must be evidence-based, with any medicinal claims made by a manufacturer supported. 'If homeopathic remedies are used without proven effectiveness on farmed fish across the EU, including the UK, the consequence could be serious animal health and welfare detriment, which would be counterproductive to both animal health and to the farmed fish industry in the UK.' Homepathic treatments are based on the principle that 'like cures like', whereby a highly diluted substance that causes the symptoms  in a healthy person, can also cure similar symptoms in a sick person. A 2010 House of Commons Science and Technology Committee report on homeopathy said that homeopathic remedies perform no better than placebos, and that the principles on which homeopathy is based are 'scientifically implausible'.","highlights":"Norwegian vets criticise EU regulations on treatment of organic fish .\nFirst line of treatment for\u00a0organic\u00a0fish should be homeopathic remedy .\nVets call directives 'scientifically illiterate', saying it delays real care .\nBritish vets say use of homeopathy could lead to serious\u00a0health\u00a0detriment .","id":"40e74678a0e8f46152063c4f8e6e2d291c3ad63e"}
{"article":"Things haven't been going well for Manchester United flop Anderson since he left Old Trafford to return to Brazil, but at least on Wednesday his own errors were outshone by the stupidity of a team-mate. The Brazilian midfielder was sent off for Internacional after a first-half off-the-ball shove on\u00a0Ypiranga Erechim striker Otacilio Neto that also saw his opponent sent off for retaliating with an elbow. But fortunately for Anderson, his colleague\u00a0Fabricio stole the limelight by swearing at his own fans and becoming the third player to be shown the red card, reducing Internacional to nine men in the 1-1 draw in Porto Alegre. Former Manchester United midfielder Anderson shoved Otacilio Neto off the ball to earn a red card . Neto also saw red after he retaliated by by appearing to aim an elbow at Anderson in Porto Alegre . The two players listen to the referee as he reaches for his card from his back pocket on Wednesday night . Anderson shows his shock to be shown the red card for what he believed to be an innocent challenge . While some players offered their hands in apology to the fans after being repeatedly booed, Fabricio took a different route and showed two middle fingers to the crowd leaving referee Luis Teixeira Rocha with no choice but to give him his marching orders. The 28-year-old left back reacted by tearing off his shirt, throwing it to the floor and shouting 'I'm leaving, I'm leaving,' as he walked down the tunnel. He has already been suspended until the end of the week by his club. Anderson ended his seven-and-a-half year association with United in February by signing a four-year deal with Internacional, but his return to Brazil has not gone as planned. Internacional's Fabricio was also sent off later in the game for aiming his middle fingers at booing fans . Fabricio threw his shirt to the ground after being shown the red card and shouted 'I'm leaving, I'm leaving' Having missed a penalty on his debut, he was substituted later in February after just 36 minutes needing oxygen while playing in the high-altitude Estadio Hernando Siles in La Paz. While Internacional sit top of the table in the Campeonato Gaucho, Anderson has faced a familiar struggle for fitness despite making eight appearances since his move. Anderson ended a miserable seven-and-a-half year spell with Manchester United by leaving this season .","highlights":"Manchester United flop Anderson was sent off for Internacional this week .\nAnderson saw red for an off-the-ball shove during the first half of 1-1 draw .\nTeam-mate Fabricio stole the limelight by swearing at his own fans .","id":"d987f48e741373781c322a3c533cc9de7b6b3f0b"}

{"article":"A Texas state trooper who did what millions of hip-hop fans would love to do and posed for a picture with Snoop Dogg was told he has ''deficiencies indicating need for counseling'. Department of Public Safety trooper Billy Spears posed for the photograph with Snoop at South by Southwest in Austin after the\u00a0rap icon delivered his keynote speech. Spears, who is based out of the state's Gilmer office, posed for the photo at the rapper's request. Scroll down for video . Department of Public Safety trooper Billy Spears (left) was disciplined last week for posing with Snoop Dogg . Snoop requested the photo at South by Southwest in Austin after the rap icon delivered his keynote speech . Spears' bosses called Snoop a figure who has a 'criminal background including numerous drug charges' After his publicist took the photo, Snoop - whose real name is\u00a0Calvin Broadus -\u00a0posted it to Instagram with the caption: 'Me n my deputy dogg'. Spears' bosses at DPS saw the posting and then cited him, according to the Dallas Morning News. The official reprimand\u00a0read: 'While working a secondary employment job, Trooper Spears took a photo with a public figure who has a well-known criminal background including numerous drug charges. 'The public figure posted the photo on social media and it reflects poorly on the Agency.' The counseling advised Spears to say no when people ask for a picture with him. Snoop has convictions for drug possession and stood trial for murder in 1993 before being acquitted. Since Spears was only reprimanded with counseling, DPS does not view the penalty as a formal disciplinary action and the trooper cannot appeal. DPS spokesman Tom Vinger said on Wednesday: 'DPS does not typically discuss or release specifics of personnel issues unless they result in disciplinary action as outlined in Government Code 411.00755 and 411.0072. 'Supervisors counsel and coach employees on a regular basis, and these efforts do not constitute formal discipline by the department.' The counseling advised Spears to say no when people ask for a picture with him but that's about it . Attorney Ty Clevenger is representing Spears and covering the case on his blog. He wrote: 'DPS claims that the counseling forms are not really discipline, therefore the employee has no right to appeal. 'Yet those counseling incidents can block a trooper\u2019s chances for promotion or advancement. 'So it appears that DPS commanders are papering Billy\u2019s file with counseling incidents because they can\u2019t prove that he violated any law, order, or policy, and they know that he will beat them with the law and the facts if he is given an opportunity to appeal.' Clevenger is calling public attention to the situation and has written letters to officials at DPS. It seems the Department of Public Safety has a problem with Snoop but Austin police seem okay with him .","highlights":"Department of Public Safety trooper Billy Spears was disciplined last week .\nThe trooper posed with Snoop Dogg after rapper's SXSW keynote speech .\nSnoop  posted picture to Instagram with the caption: 'Me n my deputy dogg'\nRapper's past legal problems were cause for concern for Spears' superiors .\nHe was cited for 'deficiencies indicating need for counseling' for photo with figure who has 'criminal background including numerous drug charges'","id":"baf8ab38efda426007bcd77f5af895bfbe187f0f"}
{"article":"Standing in a public shower cubicle with my screaming 15-month-old son, I was starting to wonder whether I truly was a Keycamp type of person. My hazy memories of similar family holidays as a child were of slow days spent on pine-scented campsites, punctuated by trips to sun-soaked beaches. But here I was, a fully-fledged father, some quarter of a century later wondering what had gone wrong. Our journey to Argeles-sur-Mer on France\u2019s Mediterranean coast went without a hitch, despite being in the minority of travellers flying, then hiring a car, rather than driving all the way. But the fatal decision was to try and wash the children, toddler Joe and five-year-old Anna, after arriving in a tired and tetchy state at Camping La Chapelle. Chris Greenwood stayed at Camping La Chappelle with his wife, Catherine, and children, Joe and Anna . Families congregated around the pools every afternoon for relief from the August heat . It was at this point I discovered that we didn\u2019t have any hot water and the baby bath had a big hole in the bottom and no plug. With stubborn determination I slung the youngest over my shoulder, grabbed some towels and trudged off to the shower block. Minutes later he had showed me the error of my ways in the way that only toddlers can. And this was something I was left to chew over, as we quickly realised neither stubbornness nor determination have a place in this land of dappled sunlight, flip-flops and fresh baguettes. The children spent plenty of time in the pool,\u00a0playing with the many new friends they made . Joe wears oversized sunglasses while relaxing by the pool at Camping La Chappelle in\u00a0Argeles-sur-Mer . Instead over the next 10 days we threw ourselves at the mercy of campsite life, simply taking the path of least resistance. With hindsight, we should, of course, on that first night have just thrown the children into bed \u2013 dirt and all \u2013 and gone swimming first thing. Eurocamp (which has since absorbed Keycamp under its banner), and its stable of mobile home accommodation, provide everything you need to make a great success of simple pleasures like these. Things have come on a long way since I was a foot shorter and my family holidayed every year in tents across the south-west of France. The Greenwood family made several trips to the pleasant Argeles beach with its mountain backdrop . Multiple swimming pools, a kids club, swings and a bakery kept the Greenwoods busy during their stay . Lugging jerry cans of water back to our tent with its zip-up compartments and constant procession of ants had its charm, but so does double-glazing, a fully-fitted kitchen and air conditioning. We stayed in a Vista three-bedroom mobile home. It\u2019s not huge, the bedrooms have the feel of a ship cabin, but it\u2019s all there. The shower is decent with plenty of hot water \u2013 once the boiler has been sparked into life by a handy courier \u2013 and you\u2019ve got your own loo and a decent size fridge. Two sets of doors lead out on to a deck, equipped with a gas-fired barbecue and, in our case, a permanent al fresco bath for Joe. Camping La Chapelle's biggest selling point is a fantastic swimming pool complex, including two water slides . Eurocamp offer sites for all types and tastes, and Camping La Chapelle is probably quite typical of a modern French campsite. This is certainly not your isolated enclave where you spend the evening listening only to the cicadas and warm wind rustling through the trees. Instead, you are likely to be able to hear the distant sounds of a German murdering a 1980s pop classic at karaoke night at the bar. But it\u2019s a trade-off if you want somewhere lively and family orientated, which this campsite certainly is. In La Chapelle\u2019s case, the biggest selling point is the fantastic swimming pool complex, including two water slides. There is even a heated pool with a retractable roof, under which we spent a memorable afternoon sheltering from a thunderstorm that rolled in from the Pyrenees. Joe and Anne, pictured with dad Chris, enjoyed the kids club, run by a team of dedicated workers . Families congregated around the pools every afternoon for relief from the August heat and Anna became an almost permanent fixture in the water, playing with the many new friends she\u2019d made on the site. So the pool became a mainstay of our pleasant daily routine, which began with picking up freshly baked bread from the campsite bakery and ended with drinks and snacks on the deck. We quickly made use of the kids club, run by a small team of dedicated and enthusiastic couriers. Four hours of varied entertainment is on offer for children aged five to 12, six days of the week, and during our stay those in charge worked hard to build a rapport with their young charges from Britain, Ireland, Germany and Holland. Chris and Catherine get into the spirit at Camping La Chappelle's campsite 'Olympics' for children . Anna enjoyed games, crafts and an X-Factor-style talent show as the club proved a hub for families staying with Keycamp and its sister company Eurocamp. The two tribes were ultimately set against each other with an evening campsite \u2018Olympics\u2019, at which I am sad to report Eurocamp cleaned up. But not before our children had soaked their couriers to the skin in a bizarre game involving body paint, shouting and many, many bottles of water. As the days went on we settled into a pleasant routine, padding about the site between the bakery, kids club, swings and swimming pools. We did venture off site most mornings, making the 10-minute walk to the pleasant Argeles beach with its mountain backdrop and host of accessible cafes, bars and a mini-supermarket. When the Greenwoods weren't in the pool they spent time on the beach in the stunning port of Collioure . A little further afield was the stunning port of Collioure, once a magnet for artists including Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso. It really is a picture postcard place, with a little bay and beach perfect for swimming, surrounded by traditional French cafes, restaurants and arts and crafts boutiques. We went back twice to make sure we hadn\u2019t missed anything in its winding maze of pretty streets. Once my wife and I found a new rhythm we pretty much all agreed that we could be Keycamp kind of people. We vowed never to force Joe to take a shower ever again though \u2013 at least not until he is big enough to take himself. Chris and his family stayed at Camping La Chapelle, Argeles-Sur-Mer, for 10 nights with Keycamp (www.eurocamp.co.uk\u00a0or 0844 406 0319), which now operates under the Eurocamp banner. Eurocamp offer self-catering holidays at more than 160 sites across Europe, including popular regions like the Dordogne, Holland and central Italy. From May 25, 2015, a seven-night stay in a two-bedroom Esprit mobile home at Camping La Chapelle starts at \u00a3427. Peak season flights with easyJet to Montpellier from Gatwick start at \u00a365 each way, plus baggage. Chris hired a car with\u00a0Europcar, which cost around \u00a3250 for 10 days, including two child seats and unlimited mileage.","highlights":"Chris Greenwood travelled with his family to\u00a0Argeles-sur-Mer, France .\nIt offers water slides and a heated pool with a retractable roof .\nPort of Collioure, located nearby, has a beach perfect for swimming .","id":"6bd78e68499c9c2f343fbc79e35661f763f89b81"}
{"article":"(CNN)It sounds like the plot for a science fiction movie. Someone has a horrific accident and winds up in the hospital, brain dead and on life support. Doctors approach the family about organ donation, but instead of saving as many as eight lives, the family is asked to donate the whole body to save just one individual. Perhaps a quadriplegic with a mind that outmatches their malfunctioning body. As crazy as this sounds, to put an entire head on a new body, a human body, Italian physician Dr. Sergio Canavero says we are approaching  HEAVEN (an acronym for head anastomosis venture; anastomosis is surgically connecting two parts). The pieces are coming together but there are still many hurdles to jump. Canavero says he has part of the funding secured, although he says he can't yet disclose where the money is coming from as a condition of the funding. He's also taking the 2015 layman's approach with crowd funding and book sales. He has identified Valery Spiridonov as the first patient. The 30-year-old Russian man suffers from a rare genetic disorder called Werdnig-Hoffman disease. Canavero says the man volunteered. The two men have talked via Skype but they have yet to meet in person and Canavero has not reviewed Spiridonov's medical records. Canavero says he has a stack of emails and letters from people who want this procedure. Many of them are transsexuals who want a new body, he says. But he insists the first patients will be people who are suffering from a muscle wasting disease. Another big obstacle is the need for a partner. Canavero can't just do this in his own Frankenstein lab. He needs a major academic medical center to host this endeavor and he has his eyes set on the United States. He hopes to get a buy-in this summer when he presents his plan to the American Academy of Neurological and Orthopedic Surgeons, or AANOS, at its annual conference in June. He's counting on getting the green light he needs for the first human whole head transplant to take place in 2017. Nick Rebel, executive director of AANOS, says the group is not endorsing Canavero, it is simply giving him a platform to hear what he has to say. If Canavero doesn't get the support he needs in the United States, he'll look to China and his timeline will slide by a year. Once these pieces are in place, Canavero says he'll put together a staff of 150 nurses and doctors. Many of them, like the patient, are already identified because they've asked to be part of this team. Then they'll need to practice for what is anticipated to be a 36-hour operation. \"I say two years is the time needed for the team to reach perfect synchronization,\" Canavero speculates. But what about the science? Is such an idea even plausible? He says he has research that supports it. Canavero points to Dr. Robert White, who transplanted the head of one monkey to the body of another at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in 1970. The monkey died after eight days, because the body rejected the new head. Before ithe monkey died, it could not move because the spinal cord of the head and body were not connected. The monkey also was unable to breathe on its own. The paper in which Canavero outlined his procedure references a different 1971 experiment White conducted with six monkey heads, none of which survived more than 24 hours. But Canavero says advances in science and medicine since then eliminate the problems White faced. Dr. Hunt Batjer, chairman of neurological surgery at UT Southwestern and president-elect of the American Association for Neurological Surgeons, says White's research is not validation for a human head transplant. \"[It's] a 45-year-old reference in a primate and there is no evidence that the spinal cord was anastomosed functionally,\" he says. Batjer further explains that it's a great leap to go from brain survival of the surgery to restoring body function, which White did not look at. Canavero is confident in his writing and in conversation. He cites White's monkeys and even the success of German researchers who helped paralyzed rats walk, giving no pause to the fact that such research is more likely to go nowhere than to make it to human clinical trials. He published his paper in the free, online, medical journal Surgical Neurology International in 2013. He walks readers through a scenario, outlining the key points that will make this work, including cooling the spinal cord before severing it. Doing so with an ultra-sharp blade will avoid the damage experienced by spinal cord injury patients, he says. He'll use a \"magic ingredient\" as a sealant to fuse the spinal cord back together and offers a few options for what that ingredient could be. The nerves, having been color-coded when separated, will be carefully aligned and this will all be done very quickly because time is key. An impossibility, according to Batjer. He conceded that the airway, the spine, the major veins and arteries, can all be put back together, but the spinal cord is the problem. He says the result would be the inability to move or breathe. \"I would not wish this on anyone, I would not allow anyone to do it to me, there are a lot of things worse than death,\" Batjer says. The science isn't there to support this, says Arthur Caplan, Ph.D., director of medical ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center. He says it's nothing more than a big PR stunt, and calls Canavero \"nuts.\" Caplan says this has to be done in many animals before it's tried on humans. Caplan also points out that if Canavero can do this, he should first be helping paralyzed patients by fixing their spinal cords, before transplanting whole bodies. As for the patients, Caplan says, \"their bodies would end up being overwhelmed with different pathways and chemistry than they are used to and they'd go crazy.\" In his paper, Canavero says identity issues could be a problem as the head gets used to its new body. He also says pain could be a problem. As far as immunosuppression, Canavero points to today's transplant successes as evidence this is not a problem. Caplan isn't buying it. He's seen how difficult it is for his NYU colleagues who perform face transplants. The levels of anti-rejection medications required are so high they put patients at risk for cancer and kidney problems. He says it doesn't make sense that you'd poison a new body with immunosuppressant medications to make a head transplant work. Another issue Caplan has seen with face transplant patients is they don't always get full function of their new organ. \"It's not like you can unscrew your head and put it on someone else,\" Caplan says. Dr. Robert Ruff, the Veterans Affairs national director for neurology, calls it farfetched and farcical, not to mention unlikely to work. He says this is more like centuries away, not years. \"It would be impossible to predict that far into the future,\" Ruff says. Canavero insists, though, \"We can already do this.\"","highlights":"Dr. Sergio Canavero says he is two years away from performing the first total human head transplant .\nThe first patient will be a 30-year-old Russian man with a rare, genetic muscle wasting disease .\nOne ethicist says Canavero should be helping paralyzed patients walk before performing body transplants .","id":"47e7ca3fa3167afec6c28143ace02265377b853c"}
{"article":"A baby girl has been badly disfigured in a dog attack at home after her parents left her by herself while they worked in nearby fields. Ten-week-old Qingqing is currently in a critical condition in hospital in eastern China, following emergency surgery to repair her mauled face. Her mother told the People's Daily Online: \u2018We left after our baby girl fell asleep. Who knew this would happen?' Recovering from surgery: Little Qingqing, who is just ten weeks old, has bandages around her damaged face . The woman, named only as Ms Li, said that on the day of the attack, she and her husband fed their daughter then went to work near their house in Haimen City, eastern China. But Ms Li could not stop thinking about her daughter so returned home after just ten minutes. When she arrived, a white dog with blood around its mouth came running towards her, she said. She dashed to the bedroom where she had left Qingqing - and discovered that the little girl had been dragged from her bed by the dog, which is believed to be a stray. Ms Li said: \u2018I nearly fainted. My baby girl was lying face flat on the floor, with blood all over.' Distraught: Qingqing's mother, identified only as Ms Li, at her daughter's bedside in hospital . The right side of Qingqing's face had been shredded and her eyelid torn off. She was carried to a local clinic by her mother but her injuries were too severe to be treated there. She was then transferred to the larger Nantong City No.3 People\u2019s Hospital, where she was operated on. She is recovering from the surgery but is suffering from a fever that is concerning her doctors. Her plastic surgeon, Dr Sun Jiyie, said: \u2018This is the youngest child with the most severe injuries we have seen from a dog bite. \u2018If she could safely power through the critical period, we will be planning more plastic surgery. But she is so young and the injuries are so severe, the operations will no doubt be very difficult.\u2019 Mrs Li, who is keeping a vigil at her daughter's bedside, said she and her husband only recently moved to Haimen after working at a greenhouse farm in another province for three years.

He also issued a general warning about dogs - saying attacks in China are more common in spring and summer. The hospital currently treats around 20 people a day for dog bites but the figure is expected to increase in the coming weeks as temperatures rise. \u2018When summer arrives, people wear less fabric, and dogs are only interested in exposed skin,' explained Dr Zhao.

{"article":"Andy Murray tied the knot with Kim Sears on Saturday at Dunblane Cathedral, as thousands of fans waited outside to greet the couple. The tennis star, who announced his engagement in November last year, tied the knot in the 12th century cathedral before a relatively small group of their family members and close friends. Reverend Colin Renwick, led the service, was pictured outside the cathedral just after 3.00pm this afternoon with the wedding taking place at around 4.00pm. Andy Murray and his wife Kim are all smiles after tying the knot at Dunblane Cathedral . Kim shows her delight after marrying British tennis star Murray on Saturday afternoon . The happy couple are covered in confetti as they make their way out of the wedding ceremony . Murray waves to his fans after making his way out of the cathedral following his wedding . Hundreds of well-wishers gathered on the streets around the cathedral and one of the biggest cheer so far has been reserved for Judy Murray, who arrived just before 4.00pm looking resplendent in a white, to-the-knee overcoat with a detailed gold dress.The outfit was topped off with a dramatic gold hat. This morning, the historic cathedral saw florists toting huge bouquets of flowers arrive to decorate the church - as hailstones and showers battered the venue. Clearly unable to contain his excitement this morning, tennis ace Murray posted a tweet to his 2.98 million followers which shows his plans for the day - through the use of emojis. He tweeted an umbrella, a picture of a church, a ring, a kiss, cake, drinks including beer, cocktails and wine and ends with hearts, a face blowing a kiss and several Zzzz icons for sleep. Murray (left) and his brother Jamie Murray (second left) arrive for his wedding to Kim Sears . Murray waves to the crowd as he arrives for the wedding as does his mother Judy in Dunblane . Kim Sears arrives for her wedding to British tennis number one Andy at Dunblane Cathedral . Andy tweeted his plans for the day through the use of emojis and it would appear he's counting on plenty of laughter, kissing and alcohol . People continue to gather outside Dunblane Cathedral just hours before the wedding is due to start at 4.30pm . The forecast for the rest of the day isn't on the couple's side although there looks like being some respite from the rain between 3pm and 4pm as guests are expected to arrive. The heavens are likely to open again around 5pm. Andy's mother Judy discussed the bad weather on social media, initially tweeting: 'Hailstones. Marvellous,' and then a few hours later: 'Snowing. White wedding.' Fans who have set up camp outside the church have found themselves battling the elements this morning as they were battered by wind, rain and sleet in short succession. Ross Hutchins (left) was a guest at the ceremony, as was former British No 1 Tim Henman and his wife . However the wet weather showed no sign of dampening the spirits of the crowds outside the cathedral. Brenda Watson travelled from Ochiltree in Ayrshire with her friend to join in the celebrations. She said: 'We forgot our hats but we're hoping the sun will shine for Andy and Kim. We're so excited about seeing them and the atmosphere is great, it's been well worth coming.' Her friend Anne Gemmell from Stair in Ayrshire said Kim's dress might be 'something lacy and just chic.' No doubt the couple will both be hoping the weather improves before the ceremony later on today - or the guests could get soaked. Murray and his brother walk into the church as they begin preparations for his wedding to Kim Sears . Hundreds of the world's media are also in place to capture the event which has sparked interest around the globe. Murray took a moment out of his wedding preparations to chat on Twitter this morning about a pre-wedding snooker game last night. Tennis player Jamie Delgado tweeted: 'Pre-wedding snooker ended in another victory for guess who? Andy Murray, Rosco Hutchins, Johnny Delgado,' to which Murray replied: 'Jamie Delgado, Rosco Hutchins, Johnny Delgado, last night was actual carnage for those boys I couldn't believe it.' The reception is being held at the 15-bedroom Cromlix House Hotel, located just outside the town, which Andy bought two years ago for \u00a31.9 million. Fans cheer as the British tennis number one Andy Murray arrives his wedding to fiance Kim Sears . Florists have been spotted working all morning to decorate the cathedral, wheeling in huge bouquets of white hydrangeas and full-sized cherry blossom trees. Hundreds of locals are expected to gather outside the cathedral to catch a glimpse of the pair who met as teenagers and have been together for more than nine years. The proud Perthshire community has spent the last few days decorating the high street with bunting in preparation for the celebration which will be reported around the globe. Murray fans have been posting their best wishes on social media and Scotland's First Minister has also offered her congratulations. Hibernian FC tweeted: 'Best wishes from everybody at #Hibs to our supporter @andy_murray on his wedding day; have a great time! First dance to Sunshine on Leith?' Murray said recently he will have three best men - his brother Jamie and friends Ross Hutchins and Carlos Mier. Sussex-born Sears, also 27, will have four bridesmaids but the style and design of her bridal gown has so far remained a secret. Several names from the world of tennis are likely to be on the guest list, with former British number one Tim Henman among those tipped to appear. Reports suggest Murray and Ms Sears had originally planned to marry at a chapel within the grounds of Cromlix House, which Murray purchased two years ago, but later opted for the 300-seat cathedral. The couple met in 2005 through tennis circles - her father Nigel is a coach and former head of women's tennis at the Lawn Tennis Association. They moved in together in 2008 and briefly split the following year before rekindling their relationship. Speculation about their engagement was fuelled by Murray who, responding to a fan's question on Twitter last year, joked that he would marry Ms Sears after Wimbledon. He was forced to point out that he was not serious but announced his engagement for real in November. Andy Murray's No 1 fans: Linda Reid-Nevitt, 62, and Amy Moffat, 15, from West Calder, wait outside of the cathedral ahead of the wedding . Murray told BBC Sport last month: 'I am actually not nervous about getting married because we've been together like nine-and-a-half years and we've lived together for six or seven years as well. 'So, I don't think a whole lot's going to change. I kind of feel like we have been married already in terms of the way we spend our lives together and live together. 'I think I will be more nervous about starting a family because that would be more life-changing, in a good way.' Yesterday the pair were spotted looking happy and relaxed as they arrived at the cathedral for their wedding rehearsal. Bride-to-be Kim, 27, wore skinny black jeans, a leather jacket and blue scarf as the final preparations were made for their big day. Hundreds of locals are expected to gather outside the cathedral to catch a glimpse of the pair who met as teenagers . Andy is a hero in his native town and the residents have pulled out all the stops to wish the happy couple well . Graham Fleming puts up bunting in Dunblane's high street as shops  decorate their fronts in support of local boy Andy . Perhaps saving her legs for walking in heels tomorrow, she today stayed casual in red flats. Meanwhile, a smiling Andy was equally casual in jeans and trainers as he made his way into the cathedral where he will make his vows this weekend. With an Olympic gold medal and Wimbledon title under his belt, Andy is a hero in his native town and the residents have pulled out all the stops to wish the happy couple well. The minister set to conduct the wedding ceremony said the whole town is excited as the event is 'the nearest we'll have in recent times to a royal wedding'. Reverend Colin Renwick said he expects Britain's top tennis star and his fiancee, Kim Sears, will be as 'nervous and as excited as any couple getting married'. The minister, who has been tight-lipped in recent weeks, said he was 'excited' to be part of the service, as final touches were added to the venue.

{"article":"A milk price war is set to break out following a landmark decision by the EU to scrap quotas restricting production . A milk price war is set to break out following a landmark decision by the EU to scrap quotas restricting production. The quota system was abolished today after 30 years - allowing dairy farmers to produce as much milk as they like without suffering a financial penalty. The move is expected to drive a spike in production, particularly in countries like Ireland, Germany and the Netherlands, who plan to boost exports of milk and other dairy products to the UK. As a result, a price war over the cost of milk is likely to break out, bringing down the price for consumers. However, British farmers are likely to find the price they are paid by supermarkets is driven down, which will be particularly difficult for smaller family businesses. Milk quotas were introduced in 1984 to address the oversupply during the late 1970s and early 1980s that had led to the infamous milk lakes and butter mountains. Farmers who produced above their quota were hit with punishing cash penalties. The new free-for-all will promote dairy factory farms, where super-size Holstein cows have been bred to produce more milk than any calf could drink in order to cut production costs. The industrialisation of dairy farming has seen the number of UK farms producing milk fall from 50,000 to 14,116 over the last 30 years. At the same time the average herd has risen from 64 cows to 134. The average milk production from Holstein dairy cows, which have been labelled \u2018udders on legs\u2019, has risen by 55per cent to 7,327 litres per animal per year \u2013 around 12,900 pints. In some cases this has been done through selective breeding programmes designed to create supersize cows, which are bulked up with high protein feed and kept inside for much of the year in what are known as \u2018zero grazing\u2019 barns. Dairy farmers have been under severe pressure in the past year as the result of a global glut in milk and a supermarket price war that drove down the price of a pint, making it cheaper than some bottled water. Some dairy processors have starting to raise farm gate prices recently, however farmers remain concerned the end of quotas could bring enormous price swings. Chairman of the dairy board at the National Farmers\u2019 Union, Rob Harrison, has urged all EU countries to act responsibly and collectively in order to manage future volatility. Mr Harrison said: \u2018Farmers and dairy processors here do have some concerns about how other EU countries will react to the ending of quotas. \u2018Some are rapidly increasing their output without an end market for these goods. With milk prices yet to show any strong signs of recovery, this could push farmgate milk prices down further in the EU, and stall any recovery in the dairy markets. \u2018It\u2019s vital that expansion in any Member State is planned in accordance with available market opportunities.\u2019 Dairy farmers have been under severe pressure in the past year as the result of a global glut in milk and a supermarket price war that drove down the price of a pint, making it cheaper than some bottled water . Mr Harrison said the new freedom could allow British dairy farmers, who are particularly efficient, to win new sales in Europe and around the world, particularly the Far East. He said: \u2018We also need UK dairy processors to recognise and promote potential markets both at home and abroad and look to develop new products such as sports drinks.\u2019 The idea of milk being promoted as a sports drink has been given credence by Coca-Cola, which has recently launched its own brand of milk in the United States. The new Fairlife milk costs more than twice as much as regular milk, but the firm believes consumers will pay more on the basis it contains 50per cent more protein and half the sugar. Earlier this week, some European farmer groups mounted a protest over the changes outside the European Parliament in Brussels, which involved a funeral march the lighting of a warning fire. The European Milk Board, a federation of dairy farmers with member organisations from 13 countries, said it was likely that the market would not be able to cope with significantly expanded production in a reasonable way. Its president, Romuald Schaber, said the changes are a particular threat to small dairy farmers, who tend to have higher costs. \u2018Chronic price collapses are inevitable, the next crisis is on its way,\u2019 he said. \u2018Prices will be rock-bottom, as Europe\u2019s farmers will have even less market power to achieve a cost-covering milk price in the future.\u2019 Maria Heubuch, an MEP for the Greens, warned about the loss of small farmers. \u2018Europe could see more factory farms with 1,000, 2,000 or even 5,000 cows, merely providing raw materials for the industry,\u2019 she said. The European Dairy Association, which represents milk processors, has backed the end of quotas. Its Secretary General, Alexander Anton, said: \u2018It goes without saying that the end of the quota will lower the administrative burden on all levels. This will naturally further enhance the competitiveness of the whole sector.\u2019 Irish dairy farmers have embarked on a massive expansion plan and will be looking to make big in-roads to the British market. A study by the Irish Farmers Association (IFA) estimated the ending of quotas would create 9,500 extra jobs in Ireland, and at least 1.3 billion euros (\u00a3950m) in extra exports. While productions restrictions have been scrapped, the EU will provide a safety net for dairy farmers. Brussels will have the power to buy-in butter and skimmed milk powder at a guaranteed figure if there is over-supply, which will shore up the price.","highlights":"Quota system abolished so farmers can produce as much milk as they like .\nProduction increase\u00a0expected\u00a0in Ireland, Germany and the Netherlands .\nCould drive down prices for British farmers who are already squeezed .","id":"7b5575eeaa16e00fdda484860708504a75f4f868"}
{"article":"An Oregon teacher is suing her rural school district over the lingering stress she feels following a surprise active shooter drill that administrators held in 2013. Linda McLean was in her classroom at Pine Eagle Charter School in the tiny town of Halfway in August of that year when a masked man in a hoodie burst in with a gun, lowered it to her head and pulled the trigger. The 56-year-old elementary school teacher had no clue it was a drill to test her 'preparedness' or that the gun was loaded with blanks. 'You're dead,' the shooter said. Shooter drill: Pine Eagle Charter school in Halfway, Oregon was the scene of a surprise 'active shooter' drill that's left teacher Linda McLean with post-traumatic fears years later . In fact, she believed for a several moments that she would soon die. Now, years after learning of the 'harebrained scheme,' Oregon Live reports that McLean is still traumatized by the event. 'McLean could not figure out what was going on,' reads the lawsuit. 'She felt very confused. Her heart was racing. She walked out of the classroom and saw a pistol lying on the ground . 'She wondered if she was really shot and was going to die.' Class was out of session that day and school officials had warned emergency services in the area not to show up should any teachers call 911. They also ran checks on all the teacher to make sure none of them had concealed weapons permits, should they decide to fight back. The two masked 'intruders' stormed a room where several teachers had gathered. 'It was shocking,' teacher Dollie Beck admitted at the time, but 'it heightened my awareness about what's around me.' But well afterwards, says the complaint, McLean's awareness was possibly too heightened. 'She could not shake the event but continued to relive it and try to make sense of it, . 'Ms. McLean could not sleep, and remained anxious and vigilant. When she drifted off to sleep, she experienced nightmares and sweating.' Doctors diagnosed McLean with\u00a0post-traumatic stress disorder and urged her to return to the school as a form of desensitization. However, 'when she returned she was short of breath, anxious, emotionally distressed, and had to leave. She has not returned to the school building since.' Now McLean wants reparations  'for her involuntary separation from employment, her medical and psychological treatment, and the loss of retirement contributions and fringe benefits.' She is suing members of the school board, the masked safety officer who ambushed her, school administrators and the alarm company that services the school for\u00a0punitive damages and attorney fees.","highlights":"Linda McLean was in her elementary school classroom in tiny Halfway, Oregon in 2013 when she was surprised by a man in a mask with a gun .","id":"a2e269938a1eb3b2e52761c5f188248aef3908da"}
{"article":"The case of a British woman allegedly murdered by her pastor husband in Ghana took an astonishing twist last week when a court was told that she died of a heroin overdose. Hotel staff found the body of pregnant Charmain Speirs face-down in a bath where it is believed she had been lying for four days. Her husband Eric Isaiah Adusah \u2013 a self-proclaimed prophet and evangelical preacher \u2013 has been charged with her murder. Pastor Eric Isaiah Adusah has been charged with the murder of his pregnant wife, Charmaine Spears . Ms Speirs and Mr Adusah, who were married last September, were said to have argued during their stay . Local news reports said an autopsy showed the mother of one died of 'opiate heroin overdose'. Mr Adusah's defence lawyer Mr Adomako Acheampong has claimed in court that 41-year-old Ms Speirs was a habitual heroin user \u2013 and that her whole family were addicted to the drug. But speaking exclusively to The Mail on Sunday, Ms Speirs's brother Paul said that his sister had never touched drugs and it was 'an outrageous lie' to say his family were all addicts. He added: 'The defence lawyer seems to be suggesting she had been a heroin addict for years but that's absolute rubbish.' The gardener, 30, admitted that he had battled heroin addiction \u2013 but said it had been Ms Speirs who ensured he sought help at a Christian-run rehabilitation centre near Glasgow. He insisted he had now been drug-free for ten years. He also said his sister, who had an eight-year-old son from a previous relationship, would not have taken any such substances of her own accord, adding: 'My sister was always against drugs.' The couple pictured on a Christmas card. Mr Adusah is the leader of Global Light Revival Ministries church based in Tottenham, north London and has been active as a preacher in Britain since 2010 . And he rejected the claim that his entire family, including parents Peter, 63, a self-employed plumber, and 61-year-old cleaner Linda, were addicted to drugs, saying: 'My parents can't stand the things.' He revealed that Charmain's family had been surprised at her 'whirlwind marriage' to Mr Adusah last September and had never trusted him. And he said that her friends had noticed changes in Ms Speirs after she met and then married 28-year-old Mr Adusah, who was based in Britain but is originally from Ghana. Ms Speirs grew up in Arbroath in the Angus region of Scotland before moving to Swansea, where she studied photojournalism and then worked as a radiography assistant for the NHS. Last year she married Mr Adusah, leader of the Global Light Revival Ministries church based in Tottenham, North London. He has been active as a preacher in Britain since 2010. The couple travelled to Ghana early last month so Mr Adusah could preach at a three-day religious rally. On March 16 after the rally the couple checked in to the upmarket Mac-Dic Royal Plaza Hotel in Koforidua for five days. But when Mr Adusah left at dawn on their second day, he reportedly told reception staff not to disturb his wife as she was 'fasting and praying', and left a Do Not Disturb notice on the door. Hotel managers became concerned when Ms Speirs would not respond when they knocked. On March 20, porters used a spare key to gain access and made the grim discovery. Now her family are desperately seeking answers as they try to piece together fragments of information. Mr Speirs said: 'We've been left in the cold, we don't know a thing. My mum and dad just want to get Charmain's body back home.' A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said: 'We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.' Mr Adusah has been charged with murder in Ghana and has had his application for bail rejected. He has not yet entered a plea. The case has been adjourned until later this month.","highlights":"Charmain Speirs allegedly murdered by pastor husband Eric Isaiah Adusah .\nCouple travelled to Ghana last month so Mr Adusah could preach at a rally .\nMs Speirs, who was pregnant, was found face-down in a bath by hotel staff .\nThe pastor's defence lawyer claimed Ms Speirs was a habitual heroin user .\nBut her brother Paul has said his sister had never touched drugs .","id":"3b1caf9d1d2bdb9fbe308ec002e9e931a3b6b7d5"}
{"article":"Many of us may not have the billionaire lifestyle or scientific prowess of Marvel's Tony Stark, but we can now at least get his trademark hi-tech gloves at home. Laser expert\u00a0Patrick Priebe  created a working Iron Man-style arm and hand that fires beams from the back of the wrist or from the wearer's palm. And in a video, the contraption is shown popping balloons and lighting matches from feet away. Scroll down for video . Laser expert Patrick Priebe  built a working Iron Man-style arm and hand that fires beams from the back of the wrist or from the wearer's palm (pictured lighting a match) The gadget was created by Wuppertal-based Mr Priebe, who designs and builds metal laser gadgets to order online. He posts videos to YouTube as\u00a0AnselmoFanZero. His Laser Gloves and Laser Gauntlet\/Arm are  available to order in varying wavelengths. Earlier this year, Mr Priebe built a laser weapon, inspired by the Gatling gun. The gun is made from aluminium and shoots rounds of 1.4-watt Class 4 blue lasers. The inventor said, although it is only strong enough to pop balloons, it is still too dangerous to be used outside . A video shows the rapid-fire weapon popping 26 balloons mounted on a wall. Eight AA batteries power the laser motor and the gun's turret is powered by four ball bearings controlled by a mechanism under the gun. As the barrel spins, the lasers - powered by lithium-ion batteries - are shot out. These range from the blue 405nm-type laser model to one fitted with 445nm, or 650nm. He also offers a 'low power green' version on his website. The gadgets are powered by Lithium-ion cells and output ranges between 0.2W and 1.2W. Prices are not known. The Laser Glove can be fired continuously for up to three minutes before the batteries need to be replaced and can be made for either the left or right hand, or both. He has previously built a Spiderman-style web shooter and Cyclops style laser glasses. Other inventions include the Bond-inspired LaserWatch, consisting of a metal case, screws, and  a built-in laser pointer. The rechargeable watch has an LED watch module and 1,500-milliwatt laser. Earlier this year, the same German inventor built a laser weapon, inspired by the Gatling gun. The gun is made from aluminium and shoots rounds of 1.4-watt Class 4 blue lasers. The inventor said that although it is only strong enough to pop balloons, it is still too dangerous to be used outside. A video shows the rapid-fire weapon popping 26 balloons mounted on a wall.

The glove was inspired by Iron Man, also known as Tony Stark, played by Robert Downey Jnr (pictured) Eight AA batteries power the laser motor and the gun's turret is powered by four ball bearings controlled by a mechanism under the gun. As the barrel spins, the lasers - powered by lithium-ion batteries - are shot out. The inventor is obviously fearful his designs will fall into the wrong hands, too, as he states on his website: 'No plans, no schematics, no blueprints'. The laser weapon is a taken on the iconic Gatling gun invented by Richard Gatling in the 1860s. Mr Priebe  previously built a Spiderman-style web shooter and Cyclops style laser glasses. Other inventions include the Bond-inspired LaserWatch, consisting of a metal case, screws, and built-in laser pointer (shown) Mr Priebe admitted  the watch was a \u2018pain in the a\u2019 to make because of all the tiny parts, and the total watch took him around 40 hours to complete. The watch is pictured popping balloons on a wall . The laser watch was inspired by 1964 Bond film Goldfinger. In this scene, Auric Goldfinger (played by Gert Fr\u00f6be) ties James Bond (Sean Connery) to a table and threatens to cut him using the laser pointer (pictured) In a video for Reactions, the American Chemical Society took a look at the science of Marvel's Avengers. Tony Stark's original suit, made only of iron, would have weighed around 70kg (150lbs) according to the ACS - not very comfortable or easy to move around in. He later upgrades it to a gold-titanium alloy, but that would actually make things worse explained the video. \u2018That suit would probably weigh around 160kg (350lbs), which might work for the Hulk but not for Tony Stark,\u2019 said the narrator. However, Dr Raychelle Burks continued that it is later made of a nickel-titanium alloy called nitinol. The American Chemical Society in Washington recently explained the science behind the Avengers in a video. It looked at the composition of Iron Man's suit - said to be a gold-titanium alloy in one of the movies - and Captain America's shield. The video also explained the science behind super-healing abilities . This is \u2018strong but light, and can be reformed after taking damage,\u2019 she said. \u2018There may also be some graphite reinforced with carbon fibre, which can take a lot of heat - useful if Iron Man doesn\u2019t want to singe his feet using those rocket boots.\u2019 None of this would work, though, without Stark\u2019s own portable nuclear power station - the Arc Reactor. In Iron Man 2 this uses palladium - but we soon learn this is poisoning and killing the character. So instead, he creates a new element - and Dr Burks said this might not be as far-fetched as it seems. He uses his own particle accelerator to smash the nuclei of atoms together and make a new type of atom, which is not entirely dissimilar to the experiments taking place at real-life accelerators such as Cern.","highlights":"Iron Man-style arm and hand was built by laser expert Patrick Priebe .\nIt fires beams from the back of the wrist or from the wearer's palm .\nIn a video, the contraption is shown popping balloons and lighting matches .\nGadget is powered by Lithium-ion cells and can be ordered from Mr Priebe .","id":"eb3614699c7e2fe02e55735ea16fac5ba57eb48c"}

{"article":"An Air Canada flight from Germany to Toronto was forced to divert to Shannon Airport in Ireland last night after an 87-year-old woman caused a disturbance on board. The pensioner, who was travelling in First Class on board the Boeing 777-300 jet, was allegedly restrained by cabin crew until the plane was forced into the unplanned landing. The flight crew alerted the pilot, who put a call in to the Irish Aviation Authority\u2019s (IAA) North Atlantic Communications Service centre at Ballygirreen in Co Clare, who advised to land at Shannon. An 87-year-old woman caused a disturbance on board an Air Canada flight from Germany to Toronto that forced a diversion to Shannon Airport . On touching down at around 8.15pm local time, Garda\u00ed\u00ad and airport police officers were standing by, and the woman was taken into custody. MailOnline Travel have been advised by Irish police that the woman has since been released without charge, and she will be undergoing a 'fit-to-fly- screening in the hope of continuing her journey. There is no indication from the police as to the actions of the woman on board at this time. The decision was taken to divert when the Air Canada flight ACA-877 was around 600 miles north west of Shannon, and the plane, carrying 211 passengers, turned around. The Irish Times report that 'airport emergency services were standing by at strategic locations along the runway so that they could follow the aircraft once it had landed.' On touching down at Shannon Airport, the elderly woman was met by Irish police and taken into custody . As expected with unscheduled landings, the plane was forced to dump fuel in advance of the descent over the Atlantic. A spokesperson for Air Canada told MailOnline Travel: 'Our flight, AC877 on Friday, April 10, Frankfurt to Toronto, diverted to Shannon due to a disruptive passenger, who was removed from the aircraft. 'It was a B777 with 211 passengers. It subsequently departed and completed its journey.'","highlights":"Air Canada flight ACA-877 set out from Frankfurt Airport, Germany .\nPilot contacted Shannon after disturbance caused on board .\nIrish police confirm 87-year-old woman was taken into custody and then released without charge this morning .","id":"a55f380c9c10eb451bf449bc13f045810ed95752"}
{"article":"Sean Donohoe, 30, from Wilnecote, Tamworth, plundered a pensioner's life savings, blowing \u00a328,500 on shopping sprees and lavish meals out . A crooked builder befriended a widowed pensioner so he could fritter away her \u00a328,500 life savings on shopping sprees and lavish meals out. Sean Donohoe, 30, from Wilnecote, Tamworth, plundered the elderly woman's accounts before spending tens of thousands of pounds on trips to the Snowdome and in shops such as Argos and HMV. He even persuaded his victim to change her will so he could reap the benefits, before secretly taking out two life insurance policies, both of which named him as the beneficiary. The builder has now been jailed for 21 months after admitting charges of fraud and theft. Sentencing him at Birmingham Crown Court, the judge said Donohoe abused the woman's trust in 'every conceivable way'. Judge Francis Laird QC said: 'You befriended her, you became a close friend and confidante. Because of your behaviour towards her she absolutely trusted you with her financial affairs. 'You abused that trust. You did so in every conceivable way. She effectively handed over her money to you. You were not a financial advisor. 'However she was an elderly lady, a widow, alone and highly vulnerable to a dishonest individual such as yourself.' The court was told how Donohoe had first befriended the woman when he carried out work on her property in Tyseley in 2007. By January 2011, he had started controlling the woman's finances. During that time, he applied for credit cards in her name and also ran up huge debts. The court heard how the victim also changed her will twice during Donohoe's two-year scam, leaving everything to the defendant. But the widow was unaware that Donohoe had taken out the life insurance policies. Lal Amarasinghe, prosecuting, said Donohoe used the money on trips to the Snowdome as well as on meals and at shops. But Department of Work and Pensions checks soon discovered that the woman's accounts were overdrawn, prompting social services to become involved. A judge at Birmingham Crown Court (pictured) said Donohoe abused the woman's trust 'in every conceivable way'. The builder has now been jailed for 21 months, after admitting theft and fraud . It led to Donohoe being arrested. Police found him in possession of four credit cards, as well as a raft of documentation, in the widow's name. In a statement after the case, the victim said: 'I thought he was a good person but I was wrong. As a result of what Sean did to me I was left with no money and worried about paying my bills months after. I am still shocked and upset that he stole thousands of pounds.' Nicholas Berry, defending, said Donohoe was suffering from anxiety and depression after the break-up of a previous relationship and had got into a financial troubles through gambling. 'He was spiralling into debt and owed his father a lot of money. At that time, quite clearly, he saw the opportunity to fleece the victim in an appalling manner,' he said.","highlights":"Sean Donohoe, 30, from Wilnecote, Tamworth, befriended woman in 2007 .\nHe took over her finances, applied for credit cards and ran up huge debts .\nHe made her change her will, secretly took out life insurance policies and abused her trust 'in every conceivable way'\nDonohoe, who admitted theft and fraud, has now been jailed for 21 months .","id":"6a586172e153ae619ddf03c165c68b8de9f8b9a4"}

The unique psychedelic cartoon, which is hand-painted, depicts the eponymous submarine from the 1968 film in which the Fab Four travel to Pepperland to save it from the Blue Meanies. The rare celluloid painting, known as a cel, was used as a master version from which artists working on the film created all other images of the wacky vessel. The first ever drawing of The Beatles' famous Yellow Submarine which is dubbed the 'holy grail of memorabilia' is set to fetch more than \u00a310,000 when it is sold at auction in Dallas, Texas, on Thursday . The rare celluloid painting, known as a cel, was used as a master version from which artists working on the Yellow Submarine film created all other images of the wacky vessel. The 1968 film starred The Beatles (above) It features handwritten notes instructing artists on the correct colours to use when recreating the submarine. More than 240 artists and animators worked full time for an entire year to produce the film using revolutionary techniques, and it is credited with helping boost the popularity of animation. Yellow Submarine was a critical success on its release and led onto The Beatles' 10th studio album the following year. The single Yellow Submarine, written by Paul McCartney and sung by Ringo Starr, had featured on the 1967 album Revolver and spent four weeks at the top of the UK charts. Original examples of cels from Yellow Submarine are so sought after that experts have tipped the submarine cartoon to fetch \u00a310,000 when it goes under the hammer on Thursday. Jim Lentz, director of animation art at Heritage Auctions which is hosting the sale in Dallas, Texas, said: 'Yellow Submarine is one of the most important animations of all time. Yellow Submarine was a success on its release and led onto The Beatles' 10th studio album a year later . The single Yellow Submarine, written by Paul McCartney and sung by Ringo Starr, had featured on the 1967 album Revolver and spent four weeks at the top of the UK charts. The original cel is set to sell for \u00a310,000 . 'It is a film that has stood the test of time and is as relevant today as when it was made in 1968. The Band Concert is the most expensive cel sold . The most expensive animation celluloid, known as cel, to be sold in the world is The Band Concert by Disney. The animation, which is noted as the first colour Mickey Mouse cartoon, was released in 1935. In the cartoon, Mickey is trying to lead a concert of the William Tell Overture, amid various distractions such as Donald Duck playing the wrong tune on his flute. The cel was sold in a private transaction in 1999 for a reported \u00a3280,000 ($420,000). 'The message of the film - all you need is love - is timeless. 'It is incredible to think the team behind the film put it together in only a year when at that time it would take up to four years to make a feature animation film. 'The animation was ground-breaking and that coupled with the fact that the film was all about the biggest band in the world is what made it so iconic. 'Amazingly, after the film was made the celluloid sheets were sold off in high street stores for as little as seven pounds. Now they are worth thousands.' 'This is a rare hand-painted colour model cel painted by the ink and paint department for cel and animation reference. 'It would be one of the earliest final versions of the Yellow Submarine hand-painted - it really is the holy grail of Yellow Submarine memorabilia. 'Since small stickers were used for when the sub travelled there are not really a great deal of Yellow Submarine cels out there. 'This comes from a former Yellow Submarine ink and paint department employee. 'It is an unusually large image. Colour model cels were used also to help determine the final approved colour scheme of the yellow submarine. 'Colour model cels from this film are very rare, and this is one of the single best cels of the Yellow Submarine we have seen.'

{"article":"Former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe says new allegations surrounding the Bradford City fire in 1985 which claimed 56 lives do not justify a new inquiry into the disaster. A new book claims that the fire at Valley Parade was just one of at least nine fires at businesses owned by or associated with the club's then chairman Stafford Heginbotham, who died in 1995. Sutcliffe, MP for Bradford South and deputy leader of Bradford City council at the time of the tragedy, says he knew Heginbotham 'flew by the seat of his pants' in terms of the finances of the club but remains convinced by the conclusion of the inquiry by high court judge Mr Justice Popplewell that the fire was an accident. A memorial to the people who dies in the 1985 fire at Valley Parade . The judge ruled the fire was started by a spectator dropping a cigarette into the rubbish that had accumulated under an old timber stand. Sutcliffe said: 'The inquiry by Mr Justice Popplewell concluded that it was caused by a discarded cigarette in what was an old wooden stand and I have not heard anything to convince me that that was not the case. 'Stafford Heginbotham was one of those football club chairmen of which there were many at the time who flew by the seat of his pants. I was deputy leader of the city council at the time and he was did fly by the seat of his pants when it came to paying the bill for the police and so on. The fire at Bradford City's Valley Parade claimed 56 victims and injured 265 on May 11, 1985 . 'But I think the inquiry was very thorough at the time and I don't think there needs to be another because of this. I do not believe there was any sort of cover-up and in fact the inquiry led to a lot of recommendations on stadiums that together with the Taylor report came up with the right answers for football. 'There will always be speculation but I just think it was a tragedy that cost the lives of 56 people and injured many more, and has scarred the city for many years.' The new claims are contained in the book 'Fifty-Six - The Story of the Bradford Fire' by Martin Fletcher, who was 12 at the time and escaped with his life from the blaze but lost three generations of his family including his father and brother. The book, published on Thursday and being serialised in The Guardian, does not make any direct allegations but Fletcher says Heginbotham's history with fires, which he claims resulted in payouts totalling around \u00a327million in today's terms, warranted further investigation. Then-Bradford chairman Stafford Heginbotham (left) with Mr Justice Popplewell in front of the burned stand . Gerry Sutcliffe does not believe a new inquiry into the Bradford fire is justified . 'Could any man really be as unlucky as Heginbotham had been?' he asks. West Yorkshire Police said the force would consider any new evidence about the fire. Detective Superintendent Mark Ridley, of the Homicide and Major Enquiry Team, said: 'The jury at the inquest in 1985 delivered a verdict of misadventure. 'However should any evidence come to light which was not available to Her Majesty's Coroner at the original inquest, then we will consider its significance and take appropriate action.' Fletcher's 11-year-old brother was the fire's youngest victim while his father John, 34, uncle Peter, 32, and grandfather Eddie, 63, also died. The disaster occurred at a time, according to Fletcher's evidence, when the businessman was in desperate financial trouble - and two days after he discovered it wo uld cost \u00a32million to bring the ground up to safety standards required by Bradford's promotion from the old Third Division. Yet this did not feature in the Popplewell Inquiry, which held its investigation only three weeks after the fire. Fletcher is the only survivor to publicly challenge the official inquiry, describing it as inadequate and saying it took place far too close to the event. The book is released on April 16. Nine days later a minute's silence is due to be held at every Premier League and Football League match to mark the forthcoming 30th anniversary.","highlights":"Gerry Sutcliffe does not believe there should be a fresh inquiry into the fire .\nThe inquiry at the time concluded the fire was started by\u00a0a discarded cigarette in  an old wooden stand .\nA new book claims former Bradford chairman\u00a0Stafford Heginbotham was linked to previous fires before the disaster .","id":"539e28fa1313e29d179bac6c4f90c60b128eea92"}
{"article":"Forget stumbling into the kitchen in the small hours and waiting for milk to heat up with a screaming baby on your arm. A self-warming bottle that heats up in 60 seconds is among the latest gizmos designed to make new mums' lives easier. While muslin squares and cotton wool have been go-to products for mums for generations, gadgets on the market in 2015 include a machine that makes 'shushing' sounds to 'break the cycle of crying' and biodegradable nappies which don't clog up landfill. Scroll down for video . The new royal baby could be clad in eco-friendly biodegradable mull-cloth as opposed to disposable nappies . Pippa Middleton, left, is said to have bought the biodegradable nappies for her new royal niece or nephew . Pippa Middleton is among those embracing eco-friendly nappies and is said to have invested in \u00a34-a-piece mull-cloth nappies for her sister the Duchess of Cambridge ahead of the birth of the new royal baby. Shoppers in Geneva, Switzerland, have reported seeing Pippa buying the nappies, which are made of natural fibres and are popular in Europe. While re-usable and biodegradable nappies are easier on the planet and will no doubt get Prince Charles' seal of approval there is also a wealth of products to make parenthood easier - whether you're royal or not. Yoomi's self-warming baby bottle promises to gently warm a baby's feed to the natural temperature of breast milk in just 60 seconds, meaning there's no need for Wills to even get out of bed when helping with night-time feeds. And if they're having trouble settling the baby and need to resort to the pushchair the royal couple can pace around the grounds of Kensington Palace in safety thanks to Buggi Lights flashing ladybirds, which clip on to the pushchair's chassis and come with\u00a0white forward facing and red rear facing flashing lights - just like a car. There's no need to get cold hands while trying to get the baby to sleep either: Mummy Mitts attach to the handle bars of the pushchair, meaning you can take your hands out while the mittens remain attached. Headlights for the pushchair and a baby 'shusher' are among the latest gadgets for mums... ...or why not try mittens that attached to the pushchair or a giraffe to rock the crib? Koo-di's spout protector is also among the list of products you never knew you needed, stopping\u00a0baby touching hot bath taps and protecting against bumps, with heat spots that change colour to indicate temperature. When it comes to bedtime the Baby Shusher puts an end to pacing round the living room for hours on end: with rhymic 'shush' sounds the device can be programmed to make 15 minutes or 30 minutes of continuous shushing. And if that doesn't work patent-pending Gerry the Giraffe attaches to car seat, cribs and baby bouncers to rock the baby for up to 30 minutes - just enough time to get your nails done. But if baby isn't sleeping because they're poorly look no further than the Spilly Spoon, a non-spill medicine spoon which promises to administer medicine without spilling it first. A self-warming bottle and a spout protector are other gadgets on offer . The Spilly Spoon is designed to look like a caterpillar and administer medicine without spilling it . 'There's a mind-boggling array of infant devices on the market, but just because something exists doesn't mean that anyone actually needs\u00a0it,' Justine Roberts, CEO of parenting website Mumsnet, told MailOnline. 'For first time parents, it's almost impossible to predict which baby products will turn out to be essentials and which will gather dust in the cupboard. Feeding: muslin squares . Sleeping: Moses basket . Clothing: Babygros, scratch mittens . Medicine: Gripe water, Calpol . Toys: Fisher Price Chatter Telephone . 'One family will find that a multi-purpose travel system fits in perfectly with their needs; another may realise that all they need for transport is a sling.' And what would Sister Julienne, Call the Midwife's profoundly practical chief midwife - or your Granny - have to say? While there's no doubt many of today's modern gadgets can make life easy for new parents, when it comes to babies there are some things which have transcended time. Muslin squares, scratch mittens and Babygros still feature on 'must have' hospital bag lists, and many new mums come home from hospital and place their bundles of joy in Moses baskets. 'Our users also find that talking to other parents - about what you do and don't need to buy, how to budget, and the realities of day-to-day finances with an extra mouth to feed - is priceless,' says Mumnet's Roberts.","highlights":"Pippa is said to have bought biodegradable nappies in Switzerland .\nBuggy lights have white forward and red rear facing lights - just like a car .\nSelf-warming bottle means new mums don't even need to get out of bed .","id":"b8d5b778770e6f5a3f1ef7ecb6738af3a3f3061e"}

{"article":"Support: Kai Windsor, now 10, with his mother Rachel . Like most boys, he always preferred football to dolls. But Kai Windsor started life as a girl \u2013 and knew from the age of three that he had been born into the wrong body. Christened Kaia, he would shun traditional girls\u2019 toys in favour of kicking a ball around. By four, he refused to wear dresses \u2013 and at six he wanted his hair cut short and developed a boyish awkwardness around girls. By nine, he had finally broken the truth to his mother Rachel, 37, telling her: \u2018I\u2019m really a boy.\u2019 Now, at the age of ten, Kai is set to undergo hormone treatment to halt puberty to stop him developing into a woman. Miss Windsor, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, said: \u2018As a toddler, Kai only wanted to play ball. As a girl, he had no interest in any dolls and made a beeline for boy\u2019s toys. \u2018And as soon as he began school, he only wanted to wear trousers as the other boys did. Soon after, I noticed he went red whenever girls were around.\u2019 Kai is not alone in facing gender problems. The number of transgender referrals to the NHS for children under 11 has quadrupled since 2009. Like many parents in her situation, Miss Windsor had never heard of children facing such issues. But the single mother, who runs a health juice business, said Kai had \u2018amazing support\u2019 from his primary school. He was given counselling when his schoolwork started to suffer, and later decided to confront the issue head-on. \u2018They were the ones who suggested Kai should have counselling,\u2019 she said. \u2018Then when he came out as transgender, they sent a letter out to all the parents in his year to explain he now wanted to be referred to as a boy. \u2018Staff then held a special lesson for all the year to explain about being transgender. And now they are even in the process of building unisex toilets to make life easier for Kai and other children like him.\u2019 Kaia pretty in pink, aged four, pictured left, and dressing up as a pirate, at five, pictured right . When Kai was born there was no outward sign he was anything other than female. Miss Windsor, who also has a daughter Jasmine, 16, from a previous relationship, said: \u2018As a toddler I usually put Kaia in dresses and bought her lots of dolls. Meanwhile, as her blonde hair grew, I put in pigtails. It simply never occurred to me she wouldn\u2019t be as feminine as her sister.\u2019 She added: \u2018Looking back Kai knew then he was a boy. He had no interest in dolls, preferring to play with a football. And when we were out he\u2019d head straight for the boy\u2019s section in shops, asking for Spiderman toys.\u2019 At seven, Kai wanted his hair cut shorter. But his grades started suffering and he was later given counselling at school. Within a few weeks, his behaviour and schoolwork improved and last year he officially became transgender after telling his mother one morning. Transgender Kai is now happy in his skin at last and is now set to undergo hormone treatment . Meanwhile, his grades immediately improved. \u2018Once people stopped referring to Kai as a girl and he could just be the little boy he wanted, he was so much happier,\u2019 she said. Kai is now set to have hormone treatment to curb puberty. If at the age of 16, he wants to complete the full transition to an adult man, he will be offered gender reassignment surgery. Miss Windsor added: \u2018There have been plenty of tears. It is hard to see your child going through such turmoil. But whatever happens I will always be there to support Kai. \u2018And right now it is just a wonderful relief to see him happy in his own skin at last.\u2019","highlights":"Kai Windsor knew from  three that he had been born in the wrong body .\nBy four he wouldn't wear dresses and by six he wanted to cut his hair short .\nKai came out at school as a transgender and is now referred to as a boy .\nAt age of 10 he is set to undergo hormone treatment to halt puberty .","id":"248744951873e4ba25c323f958226235e696a060"}

{"article":"Bayern Munich have joined Manchester United and Liverpool in the race to sign\u00a0Memphis Depay. The PSV Eindhoven star's talents have been compared to those of a young Cristiano Ronaldo by Ronald de Boer, who also claims United could have the edge over Liverpool in a battle for the Holland forward. The 21-year-old Dutch international has played a starring role in PSV's Eredivisie title success this season. He is the subject of offers from Liverpool and Paris St Germain while United have also made contact. Liverpool are making a rival push for Manchester United target Memphis Depay . Liverpool hope to convince 21-year-old Depay that he would get more regular football with them . De Boer has been impressed and suggested he could follow in the footsteps of one of Old Trafford's former greats and become one of the world's best players. '(Depay) is one of the biggest talents in Europe,' said De Boer on talkSPORT. 'He has skill compared to a young Cristiano Ronaldo. He is very lively, technically unbelievable, very skilful, very fast, he has a great goalscoring record, he can shoot from every distance - he has everything. 'For me, he is without doubt one of the best talents we have.' De Boer, the former Ajax, Barcelona and Holland midfielder who is now assistant manager of Ajax's youth team, believes the presence of Louis van Gaal as manager could give United an advantage. Depay played under Van Gaal during the latter's spell as national team boss. 'I don't want to say which club is more suitable for him, but if he goes to United he knows there is a Dutch coach there who knows him from the World Cup,' said De Boer. 'That is an advantage.' PSV Eindhoven won their first Eredivisie title in seven years after beating Heerenveen 4-1 on Saturday . Depay (right) celebrates the Dutch giants' success with manager\u00a0Phillip Cocu after the match . Pep Guardiola and his staff are planning for the long-term with wingers Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery growing older and picking up more injuries. Bayern are keen on Wolfsburg's Kevin de Bruyne too and Real Madrid's Gareth Bale. The latter wants to stay in Spain but De Bruyne, a firm target for Manchester City, could be sold at around \u00a340m while PSV want \u00a320m for Depay. Liverpool hope to convince Depay that he would get more regular football with them but their qualification for the Champions League could be crucial to the 23-goal winger choosing them over United. PSV value Depay at \u00a325million and rejected a \u00a314million bid from Tottenham for him last summer. PSV Eindhoven general manager Toon Gerbrands said: 'We have given an indication of the price for Depay, which is probably more than \u20ac25m. Therefore we can have no quibbles with Depay's management [over the price]. Gerbrands added: 'Depay must first reach an agreement with a club and if that club are willing to pay the transfer fee then he can leave quickly.' Early years and PSV Eindhoven . Born in 1994, Depay started out at hometown club VV Moordrecht - a Dutch amateur side in south Holland - at the age of six before joining Sparta Rotterdam three years later. The son of a Ghanaian father and Dutch mother, Depay moved to PSV at the age of 12 before making his first-team debut in September 2011 having impressed during a trial. Depay signed his first professional contract in June 2012 and has already made over 100 appearances for the Dutch giants. Playing style . Pacy, with neat close control, Depay loves to run at defenders and completed the most dribbles in the entire Eredivisie during the 2013\/14 campaign. Adding more goals to his game this season, the youngster is more than capable at shooting from distance and boasts an explosive right-foot. Often playing on the left-wing and cutting inside, Depay is strong on the ball and has more than a few tricks up his sleeve to bamboozle opponents. However, still at a young age and learning the game, the 21-year-old can sometimes be guilty of making the wrong pass or keeping hold of the ball for too long. Talent to one day match Arjen Robben... and already better than a young Cristiano Ronaldo? While Depay has been tipped to become as good as Dutch star Arjen Robben by PSV manager Phillip Cocu, one man believes the Holland youngster could one day rival Cristiano Ronaldo. Ed van Steijn, the man who scouted Ronaldo for Manchester United, believes Depay is better than the Real Madrid star was at the same age. Speaking to Dutch daily newspaper Algemeen Dagblad, Van Steijn said: 'If I compare him to a young Cristiano Ronaldo at the time, then Depay has more strings to his bow. I like him better. 'Ronaldo did the same things wrong at Manchester United as he did when he was 17.' Meanwhile, former Holland midfielder Cocu said of Depay: 'Whether he can be as good as Arjen Robben? I think so. 'They are different players, but they are both fast and have a good shot. And both always have the urge to learn. 'But Memphis is only 21-years-old and only in a few years can real conclusions be drawn.' Depay's PSV team-mate Stijn Schaars is also a fan and told Helden Online: 'He's doing everything to reach the top. 'He has a body of a true athlete, power and flair. I'm not afraid of him losing his head. His drive is huge. I like him a lot.' International star and World Cup goalscorer . Depay was handed his first Oranje call-up by Louis van Gaal in 2013 and was selected for Holland's World Cup squad a year later. The energetic frontman scored the winning goal in Holland's 3-2 victory over Australia, before coming off the bench to net against Chile and help Van Gaal's men seal top spot in Group B. Having impressed in Brazil, Depay was nominated for the tournament's 'Best Young Player' award but lost out to France midfielder Paul Pogba.

{"article":"Jay Z launched a stream of tweets defending his premium music streaming app Tidal after the service, launched last month, was described as a flop. His social media diatribe comes as reports claim that Tidal is being sabotaged by rivals as it attempts to take business away from more-established music outlets such as Spotify and Apple. 'We may not be perfect - but we are determined,' he said while claiming that there are 'many big companies that are spending millions on a smear campaign'. 'We are here for the long haul,' the rapper and businessman tweeted in a string of 'stream of consciousness' messages. Scroll down for video . Twitter rant: Jay Z unleashed a string of 'stream of consciousness' tweets on Sunday defending his premium music streaming service Tidal and saying that it is still early days for the app . Tidal tweets: Using the hashtag #TidalFacts, the rap mogul told naysayers that 'actions will speak louder than words' as he continues to fine tune the streaming service he purchased for $56 million in January . Equality for all: The rapper and businessman insisted that Tidal is good for all artists and not just a money-maker for the big name artists like Kanye, Rihanna and Madonna who have joined him as co-founders . Feeling the need to vent: Jay Z decided to take to social media on Sunday in an aggressive push after what he saw as a 'smear campaign' from big companies against Tidal . Jay Z, who paid $56 million for TIDAL's technology in January and relaunched it in March, went on the offensive against the supposed smear campaign. Tidal has potential rivals including popular streaming service Spotify and tech giant Apple, though Jay Z did not post any details about the alleged campaign. After Tidal was criticized because of the wealth of its founders, the rapper said that other big tech companies also have huge amounts of money. 'Rich getting richer? Equity values... YouTube $390 billion. Apple $760 billion. Spotify $8 billion. Tidal $60 million,' he said. On Sunday Page Six\u00a0claimed that there's also a 'war' looming between Tidal and Apple. Citing industry sources, the New York Post's gossip site alleged that tech giant Apple is trying to impede Tidal ahead of the scheduled relaunch in June of its own Beats Music by taking a long time to approve iOS updates for the Tidal app. 'Tidal had a new app on Android on April 15, but still hasn\u2019t received approval for Apple\u2019s iOS app store,' a source said. The site claimed that after Rihanna's song American Oxygen debuted on Tidal, there were technical problems with her music on iTunes. Apple told Page Six that the allegations that Rihanna's songs were deliberately scrambled are not true. The spokesperson declined to comment on the other claims made in the article, according to Page Six. War looming: A report from Page Six on Sunday said that Apple, which is launching its own music service, is trying to stop any growth by Tidal by delaying availability of updates for its app . Big guns: Tidal charges users $19.99 a month for its premium music streaming service and aims to take on rivals such as Spotify, Pandora and Apple's iTunes. Madonna and Rihanna are among the company's backers . In the same article, Page Six also alleged that Robert Kondrk, vice president of iTunes Content, has said any artists who put out exclusive music on Tidal won't be featured artists on iTunes. The article also reported that Sony Music will not grant Tidal a license to stream from Sony artists, one of whom is, of course, Jay Z's wife Beyonce. A representative for Sony Music declined to comment to Page Six. A month ago, some of the biggest names in music joined Jay Z for the launch of Tidal but the $19.99 a month subscription service is floundering in the app downloads charts. According to Billboard.com\u00a0on Sunday, Tidal, which launched on March 30, has fallen out of Apple's top 750 apps, after a peak at No. 83 on April 7. The rapper's Twitter rant and news of tensions with other tech companies come after a week of bad press for TIDAL. The company's CEO Andy Chen also recently left the company amid a 'streamlining' of staff. Even those close to Jay-Z were seen as moving away from the potential failure. Co-founder Kanye West changed his Twitter avatar away from a logo for the service and deleted all mention of it from his account earlier this week. He later reaffirmed his support for the service in a tweet saying 'The love of music is louder than words'. Despite reports of its stuttering start, Jay-Z insisted on Twitter that Tidal is doing just fine. 'We have over 770,000 subs. We have been in business less than one month,' he tweeted, and included the hashtag #TidalFacts. Tweet of support: Canadian producer and performer Deadmaus5, who joined Jay Z on stage at the New York relaunch of Tidal on March 31, used his Twitter account Sunday to support the company . Tidal is co-owned by Jay Z, Kanye West, Beyonce, Madonna, Rihanna, Jack White, Alicia Keys and others. In his Sunday stream of tweets, Jay Z stressed that the service pays a 75 percent royalty rate to all artists and not just the high profile founders who appeared on stage at the launch. Other info he shared under the hashtag #TidalFacts included that 'iTunes Store wasn't built in a day' and 'It took Spotify 9 years to be successful.' TIDAL has attempted to differentiate away from its competitors by billing itself as having higher quality audio and being focused on rewarding those making music. Jay-Z referenced Tidal X which 'supports artists by giving them a platform to connect with their most loyal fans. Tidal is for all.' Canadian producer and performer Deadmaus5, who joined Jay Z on stage for the Tidal \u00a0launch in New York, jumped on the bandwagon Sunday. He tweeting his followers: \u00a0'despite whatever dumbs**t preconceptions you may or may not have about tidal, im still behind it. Im in it for industry growth, not PR. (sic).' Several artists have publicly criticized the roll-out, saying that Jay Z made it seem as if some of the world's biggest musicians wanted more money. 'When they say it's artist-owned, it's owned by those rich, wealthy artists,' Marcus Mumford, the frontman of Mumford & Sons, said in a recent and widely-disseminated interview with The Daily Beast website. Friction: Page Six claimed Sunday that Sony Music won't give Tidal a license to stream music by artists signed to it labels, which include Jay Z's wife Beyonce . Not all artists are fans: Marcus Mumford of Mumford & Sons has criticized Tidal saying it's just a way for wealthy artists to get richer .","highlights":"Rapper says that his streaming service is 'here for the long haul'\nReport claims that app is being affected by delays from Apple, which is launching its own music service this summer .\nJay Z claims that Tidal already has more than 700,000 subscribers .\nApp purchasing data shows that it has fallen out of top 750 downloads .","id":"7b594392b5977ba72bd1faec3c79b38784670b6d"}

{"article":"(CNN)I've visited Nepal at least half a dozen times over the last decade, and of the more than 100 countries that Save the Children serves, it is undoubtedly one of my favorites. There are the usual things that are said about it -- the stunning landscape, which includes Mount Everest, and the amazing food. But Nepal has also made some of the most remarkable progress on maternal and child health in the last few years. In fact, I remember a time just last May when I sat with a group of mothers and their tiny babies as they told me how proud they were that they now understood how important it was to make sure they prioritized breastfeeding and nutritious foods. They spoke of the wonderful future they were now expecting for their children, and they shared with me the big dreams that they had. So you can imagine the indescribable sadness I experienced waking up this morning and seeing the news reports that Nepal had been hit by its worst earthquake since 1934, when more than 10,000 people were killed. While casualty accounts following the magnitude-7.8 quake Saturday are still difficult to confirm -- hardly surprising considering that communication lines have been severely disrupted -- estimates we are hearing from the ground are already placing the number lost in the thousands, with the official toll now at around 1,500 expected to keep growing as the hours and days pass. The fact that the epicenter of this quake was so close to the capital of Kathmandu, where the majority of Nepal's citizens reside, makes the situation even more dire. Many of these people live in cramped conditions and have never lived outside the city. As a result, it is unlikely they even have a home village to go to temporarily for shelter. Housing the scores of newly homeless will be a tall order. It is still quite cold at night in Nepal, so getting these people into shelters quickly will be of the utmost importance. Compounding this very serious problem will be the difficulty in ensuring that those affected have access to clean water in the coming days; Nepal already had one of the lowest standards of sanitation in the world before the quake. In fact, even getting food to people will be a logistical nightmare, given that the entire country -- which is about the size of Tennessee -- is served by only two main roads, which have likely been badly damaged, if not destroyed. We have been in situations like this before, and know what to do. But time is not on our side -- we have only a few short weeks before the rainy season begins, which will make an already difficult job close to impossible. With that in mind, we have set up a fund to help address the immediate needs of children, who are always the most vulnerable in an emergency. We and other relief organizations will be doing everything we can to help get Nepal back on its feet without having to wait for more people to die from diseases that will inevitably come from contaminated water and the like. Only the oldest Nepalese will remember the last major earthquake, so the psychological toll for the majority of the country will be a significant and ongoing concerning for us as we and other agencies launch our response. And while we can rebuild Nepal after this tragedy, it will take time and help. I hope that we can all play a role in making sure that the tremendous gains that have been made in this country that I love so dearly will not have been in vain.","highlights":"A magnitude-7.8 earthquake struck near Kathmandu, Nepal .\nCarolyn Miles: Many survivors will have nowhere to go .","id":"e14276453cc580e75e295f42454e7a15595df4fb"}
{"article":"Lewis Hamilton is getting inside teammate Nico Rosberg\u2019s head as the German bids to win his first World Championship title, according to two time winner Mika Hakkinen. Rosberg accused Mercedes team-mate Hamilton of deliberately compromising his race at last weekend\u2019s Chinese Grand Prix by slowing down but Mika Hakkinen said the British driver\u2019s tactics, which saw him win a third consecutive Grand Prix ahead of the German, were entirely legitimate. \u2018If you are leading a race that's a fantastic place to be and what goes in your mind when you are leading into finish the race first,\u2019 said Hakkinen. Lewis Hamilton celebrates his win with the Mercedes team, but Nico Rosberg appears less pleased with 2nd . Rosberg accused Hamilton of being selfish by driving too slow and compromising his second position . Hamilton crossed the line to claim his second win of the season and his fourth in China . \u2018So you do everything with the team in the right way so you are able to finish the race first.\u00a0If you have to save tyres, brakes, engine, gearbox whatever it is, that's what you do. 'You don't think about the guy behind you, what he is feeling, how his car is handling or how you want his car to handle at the end of the race you just take care of your own stuff. \u2018I have been in this situation with Michael [Schumacher] where where I was much quicker than him and he was definitely challenging me in a very interesting way,\u2019 added Hakkinen. \u2018What Lewis and Nico are going through at the moment, they are having a very difficult challenge, already last year and there are challenges continuing this year between them. Rosberg responded to a fan who accused him of 'crying' after he complained about Hamilton . Former world champion Mika Hakkinen says Hamilton was well within his rights to look after himself . Hamilton celebrates with with his trophy and bottle of champagne after his race win . 'They are the drivers with the best possible chance of winning at the moment. It requires a lot of nerves from the drivers to be able to be a good racing driver and not to start fighting because it doesn't make any difference.\u2019 Hamilton, who is bidding to win a third World Championship title this season, has out-qualified and out-raced Rosberg in all three grand prix and Rosberg will likely be feeling the pressure according to Hakkinen. \u2018Nico has definitely got big pressure on him,\u2019 said Hakkinen, \u2018He doesn't know how it feels to be a world champion and doesn't know what confidence a world championship generates inside you when you are racing driver. \u2018He is still hunting that feeling. He wants to win but first he has to beat Lewis but Nico is a great driver and if you look at the qualifying result at the last grand prix the time difference was hardly nothing. I don't say that pole position is the key point to win a grand prix certainly it helps to start in pole.\u2019 Lewis, many congratulations. Was the race as expected in terms of the challenge from Ferrari and, also, can you talk us through that radio message you got from the team about speeding up? Were you aware that Nico was getting so backed-up towards Sebastian Vettel? LH: I wasn\u2019t controlling his race, I was controlling my own race but, great race, I\u2019m really happy. Definitely going into the race we thought it would be a lot closer and we knew the Ferraris were very, very good with their long run pace and also looking after their tyres. So, today the real goal was to manage the tyres. And, as I said, my goal was to look after my car. I had no real threat from Nico through the whole race. So, I just managed it and got to really enjoy it, to be honest. A few of the real good fun laps were the laps before the pitstop, which I really enjoyed. Ultimately it was a much smoother weekend than we had in the last race where we got the whole, full practice sessions, on my side of the garage at least. And it made a real big difference to the balance of the car for the race. So really happy, and yeah, kinda excited. Q: Nico, can you talk us through your view of the race today. Started second, finished second but you sounded at times as though you felt at times under a little bit of unnecessary pressure maybe? NR: No. It\u2019s just now interesting to hear from you, Lewis, that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace in front, and necessarily that was compromising my race. Driving slower than was maybe necessary at the beginning of stints meant that Sebastian was very close to me and that opened up the opportunity for Sebastian to try that early pit-stop to try and jump me. And then I had to cover him. So, first of all it was unnecessarily close with Sebastian as a result, and also it cost me a lot of race time as a result because I had to cover him and then my tyres died at the end of the race because my stint was just so much longer. So I\u2019m unhappy about that, of course, today. Other than that, not much to say. Q: Lewis, would you like to respond? LH: Not really! My job is not to\u2026 it\u2019s not my job to look after Nico\u2019s race. My job\u2019s to manage the car and bring the car home as healthy and as fast as possible \u2013 and that\u2019s what I did. I didn\u2019t do anything intentionally to slow any of the cars up. I just was focussing on myself. If Nico wanted to get by he could have tried but he didn\u2019t.","highlights":"Lewis Hamilton won the Chinese GP with Nico Rosberg finishing second .\nRosberg accused his team-mate of being selfish by driving too slow .\nMika Hakkinen says Hamilton was right to worry about his own race .\nREAD: Hamilton insists Rosberg was not trying to win in Shanghai .\nREAD: Hamilton ready for Rosberg's underhand tactics .","id":"2f18b59479bba620ad2438c6de0cc193518cd796"}
{"article":"Former Arsenal and England defender Sol Campbell is part of a new campaign to encourage minorities to register to vote in next month's general election. Campbell has joined forces with Homeland actor David Harewood, musician Tinie Tempah and\u00a0Paralympic medallist\/\/television presenter Ade Adepitan. The campaign, run by Operation Black Vote, features the stars in striking photographs ahead of the voting registration deadline on April 20. Sol Campbell is part of a new campaign to encourage minorities to register to vote for the General Election . Ex-England star Campbell retired from football in 2012 and is considering a career in politics . Campbell, 40, last month ruled out standing for the Conservatives in Kensington after\u00a0Sir Malcolm Rifkind announced he would be standing down. At the time he said his 'ambitions lie elsewhere in the political arena' which led to speculation he could run for London Mayor. Campbell posed for a photograph with his face coloured white alongside the caption, 'If you don't register to vote, you're taking the colour out of Britain.' And on launching the campaign,\u00a0Harewood said: 'What it brilliantly illustrates is that if you don't register to vote, you are quite literally taking all the vibrancy we have in our community off the table . 'If you don't register to vote, politicians don't really care about you, politicians aren't really caring about what you have to say, what you have to do, anything. Campbell won 73 caps for his country, scoring one goal over the space of nine years . 'The only way they talk to you is if you register to vote. That is when you become an important part of the electorate.' Operation Black Vote also launched a 2015 general election manifesto with the aim of 'reclaiming democracy, empowering citizens and fighting race equalities'. It says that in the past black and minority ethnic (BME) groups presented a broad range of 'key policy demands' to all parties, but adds: 'Our experience shows that whilst all parties express interest in our proposals during elections, this interest soon evaporates once in power.' Instead OBV has created a list of manifesto points of its own, including automatic voter registration linked to the National Insurance system, the introduction of e-voting and proportional representation, voting from the age of 16, state funding of parties and a 'minister for race equality' in the Cabinet.

{"article":"(CNN)She predicted events that unfolded in the Middle East well before they happened. And her book on Iraq became required reading for many military leaders trying to understand the country. Veteran journalist and author Sandra Mackey died Sunday, her son, Colin Mackey, said. She was 77. Her extensive career began in anonymity. She was an undercover reporter working for U.S. newspapers from Saudi Arabia as her husband, Dr. Dan Mackey, worked in a Riyadh hospital. For four years, she hid her writing from the authorities and smuggled her stories out of the country to get around Saudi Arabia's prohibition on foreign journalists. Her work appeared under the pseudonym Michael Collins. As she chronicled what was happening around her, Mackey's distinctive voice began to emerge. Over the years, a stream of books followed. \"The Saudis: Inside the Desert Kingdom\" offered \"a rare first-hand glimpse into the hidden realm of Saudi social and public life,\" The New York Times wrote. Her 1992 book \"Passion and Politics: The Turbulent World of the Arabs\" helped bridge gaps in understanding between Arabs and Americans, critics wrote. Mackey wrote for the people she knew, in a layman's language that was rooted in her training as a high school history teacher. \"Scholars may be put off by Mackey's occasionally florid, bombastic language, but her work is a sound analysis and a sympathetic yet balanced effort to explain Arab perspectives to Americans,\" Elizabeth R. Hayford wrote in Library Journal. After earning a history degree from the University of Central Oklahoma, Mackey attended the University of Virginia to study international relations. She graduated in the first class of women admitted to the graduate program. For her book on Iran, Mackey was three times able to win permission to travel through the country unaccompanied, allowing her to paint an intimate portrait of a country going through extraordinary change. Her 2002 book \"The Reckoning -- Iraq and the Legacy of Saddam Hussein\" portended some of the outcomes of the war in Iraq -- but also drew some sharp criticism. \"If war prevails, we shall beget a greater disorder in the Persian Gulf,\" Mackey wrote in the book. \"We will be sucked into the resentments of the Arab world, the hostilities of the Iraqis, and the challenge of nation building in what has become an intensely tribal society at the core of American vital interests in the oil-rich Persian Gulf.'' Fouad Ajami, the late Hoover Institute fellow who was also a frequent guest on CNN, took issue with the book. \"The crowds in Baghdad and Basra (like the crowds in Kabul that greeted their liberators with kites and music) may yet embarrass Mackey and the countless naive people who see things her way,\"  Ajami wrote for The New York Times' Sunday Book Review cover story in 2002. Mackey had an Oklahoma twang, the slightly nasal kind that she was proud of, but that belied her worldly understanding. She would use it to full effect when she wanted to put people at ease. Mackey was a frequent commentator on CNN during the Gulf War in the 1990s. She also appeared on countless other outlets, including Bill Maher's \"Politically Incorrect,\" to explain in layman's terms what was happening in the region. Her book on Iraq was published one year before the U.S.-led invasion of the country in 2003. The book forewarned of the consequences of such action. \"In a perfect world, Shia, Sunni, and Kurd, followed by a company of other minorities, would walk into the post-Hussein Iraq as a liberated people united by common suffering,\" Mackey wrote. \"But as all those who plot the way of nations are so acutely aware, the world is not perfect.\" She said those calling for an invasion of Iraq \"cannot ignore the threats to American security that could come with Hussein's demise.\" \"With American troops on the ground and no governing authority capable of taking charge, the United States faces the real possibility of a secular version of militant Islam,\" Mackey said. \"... Thus, American military forces rotate in and out, U.S. taxpayer money finances the occupation, and Iraqi hostility to a Western presence increases. There is no exit strategy except retreat.\" In 2004 the U.S. military actually flew Mackey to Iraq to teach commanders from the Army's 1st Infantry Division while the war was still raging. Her book on Iraq became required reading for many military officers. \"I am literally a little old lady in tennis shoes,\" she used to joke about her ability to gain the confidence of countless sources.  \"What's the harm in talking to me?\"","highlights":"Mackey predicted what would happen to Iraq if the U.S. invaded and deposed Saddam Hussein .\nShe also wrote a book credited with helping bridge gap between Arabs and Americans .","id":"108001053b37e8d61251047cdbbdbc8bdec48e94"}
{"article":"An exotic bird in Brazil was recorded making incredible sounds that wouldn\u2019t be out of place on a video game. The Curl-crested Jay, which resides at the Criadouro Onca Pintada breeding centre, is native to South America and is known to be a good mimic of other birds and man-made sounds. With the ever-growing presence of human\u2019s in their natural habitats, the bird is one example of a number of species that have learned to incorporate peculiar everyday sounds into their song. Videoed behind a fence, the bird initially makes a sinister noise like a distorted voice before creating an almost digital sound. Following this the bird makes a noise that sounds like running water before a Space Invaders style tune emerges from it. Discussing the video, companion parrot behavioural expert Greg Glendell spoke with MailOnline about the various theories regarding the function of these sounds. The Curl-crested Jay is native to South America and resides at the Criadouro Onca Pintada breeding centre . \u2018Several groups of birds have a lifelong ability to learn to reproduce new sounds; notably parrots, starlings and crows,\u2019 said Mr Glendell. The particular Jay belongs to the Crow\/Corvidae family. \u2018Some birds may use them to impress a mate or their peers within their flock,\u2019 he added. \u2018Most birds using mimicry are highly social species, with a complex vocal repertoire, which includes innate calls and learnt calls. The bird is one example of a number of species that have learned to incorporate peculiar everyday sounds into their song . \u2018As social species they use their calls as language. There are often regional dialects within bird groups. So the same species shows differences in its calls across its range.\u2019 Mr Glendell also noted that sometimes captive birds confined to cages use their ability to mimic to relieve their boredom and ensure responses from their owners. The original video was uploaded to YouTube account: Swiatoczamigoski by a Polish-based blogger who has spent some time volunteering at the Brazilian breeding centre.

{"article":"Janet Faal, who has suffered from agoraphobia for a decade, fell down an uncovered manhole . An agoraphobic grandmother who conquered her fear of open spaces and left home for the third time in 10 years only to fall down a manhole. Janet Faal, 57, was out with a friend in Crawley, West Sussex, as part of her rehabilitation when she moved a wooden pallet to help them reverse and plunged down into the open gap. She now has two black eyes and a suspected fractured leg after smashing her face on the pallet and was left in a 'splits' position as only one of her legs went down the hole when she slipped. The grandmother-of-four said: 'I was with a friend helping her reverse out of a car park, and there was this wooden pallet in the way. 'I moved the pallet out of the way with my foot and I was going to turn around to my friend say \"is that far enough?\". 'I took a step over - never in my life did I think there was a hole underneath, I thought it had just fallen over. The next thing I remember is the pain. It was awful. 'I fell and smashed my face on the pallet, and I was in the hole with blood all over me and I couldn't move.' She reckons she has been set back 'years' in her battle with the debilitating condition, which has left her housebound for a decade, and fears she'll never leave her home again. Miss Faal, who lives in Crawley, said: 'It's hard for me to go anywhere, but I was getting better. Now I'm not so sure.' She spent nearly an hour waiting in agony on the forecourt of Complete Tyre Services on Friday, April 10, before a paramedic arrived to take her to East Surrey hospital. Scroll down for video . Her son Andy MacDonald, 39, a painter and decorator, said: 'I'm absolutely livid. Whoever owns that manhole should get it fixed and get it fixed right now. 'It's ruined my mother's recovery. I can't believe it. Whoever owns that manhole has something serious to answer for. Miss Faal was trying to move a wooden pallet when she fell down the gap, smashing her face and trapping her leg on the way down. She's been left with two black eyes and bruising . 'I'm self-employed, and I have to take time off work to care for my disabled mum, who has been knocked for six by negligence. 'If she was smaller she would have gone all of the way down - a slender woman or child could have been very seriously hurt.' An employee at the company, where Miss Faal's friend had driven her to get a new tyre for her car, claimed the holes have been reported 'loads of times' to the owner of the site. The manhole (pictured) at Complete Tyre Services in Crawley had been covered by a wooden pallet . The site is leased from the owner of JP Supplies, which sells safety clothing to the construction industry in the neighbouring unit. A spokesman for South East Coast Ambulance Service confirmed its attendance and explained why it took so long for an ambulance to arrive. He said: 'When the call came in, with the information provided by the caller, it was classified as a \"class C\" call. 'We always do our best to back up the first paramedic as soon as we can but life-threatening calls have to take priority.' Neither the tyre shop or their landlord JP Supplies are accepting responsibility for fixing the broken manhole. A worker at the garage said: 'We have been trying to get the manholes in the forecourt fixed for years, but what's happened is they were covered with pallets.' The building owner, who also runs nearby business JP Services, said: 'They are the tenants, so it's down to them to fix the manhole cover. 'I'm the landlord, but they have not spoken to me about it.' Agoraphobia is 'a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult, or help wouldn't be available if things went wrong', according to the NHS website. The site explains that though it's often thought that the condition is a fear of open spaces the reality is not quite as straightforward, with some sufferers also fearing public transport and shopping centres. When agoraphobics are exposed to their fears several symptoms can sweep over them, including a feeling of nausea, rapid heartbeat and breathing, and rising temperature. The cause of agoraphobia can vary from person to person, with some people developing a fear of a certain situation or place because they experienced a panic attack there and then try to avoid it. Others may develop the condition through a fear of crime or being involved in an accident. Treatments may involve counselling, relaxation training or taking antidepressants. NHS Direct says: 'In the UK, up to two people in 100 have a panic disorder and it is . thought around a third of those will go on to develop agoraphobia as a . result.'

{"article":"Disabled children can face a lot of challenges - but one photographer from Washington wants to make sure they\u00a0recognize that they all have a super-human ability to conquer any challenge set before them. For\u00a0The Superhero Project, Renee Bergeron, 38, photographs children with special needs as superheroes, dressing them up with capes, goggles, and wands in order to make them feel like they can do anything. 'I think a lot of people look at others with special needs and think of them as \"less\" in some ways,' Mrs. Bergeron, who also has a parenting blog, recently told The Mighty. 'Let\u2019s face it, though \u2014 these kids are all fighters. The obstacles they overcome daily just to cope in our world ought to make us all see them as superheroes.' Caped crusader: Avery, pictured, was photographed for Renee Bergeron's Superhero Project; Avery was born prematurely, has had multiple brain surgeries, and has a feeding tube in her stomach . Powerful shots: Mila, left, suffers from speech disorders, while Mordecai, right, was diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder and has several missing fingers and toes . Mrs. Bergeron's first little superhero subject was her own son, Apollo, now four. Apollo was diagnosed with a rare heart defect when he was 18 months old and, in addition to undergoing several medical procedures and surgeries, had to be fitted with a feeding tube at a young age. Despite his health problems and the tube protruding from his stomach, when Apollo was two, Mrs. Bergeron said, he would pose for pictures with 'such strength and confidence'. His mother knew that one day Apollo might feel self-conscious about the tube, so she wanted to document him looking strong and proud, in the hopes that the images might inspire him to feel that way again later on in life. Proud princess: Victoria, pictured, was born with Congenital Femoral Deficiency, which affects her legs, hips, and knees . Super cute: Mrs. Bergeron's son Apollo, left, was her first subject; Melanie, right, is autistic, epileptic, and has Sensory Processing Disorder . After speaking to other moms of children with special needs on Facebook, Mrs. Bergeron decided to take similarly empowering photographs of more disabled children. In 2013, she began working on the The Superhero Project, taking pictures of children with physical disabilities, autism, and sensory disorders\u00a0free of charge. After Apollo, she photographed Avery, a little girl born prematurely who underwent multiple brain surgeries, Melanie, a four-year-old with autism and\u00a0epilepsy, and Cody, a red-headed boy with Down syndrome. Tough cookie: Mrs. Bergeron says she 'seriously fell in love with' Cody, pictured, who has Down syndrome,\u00a0Sensory Processing Disorder, and Speech Apraxia . Watch out, bad guys: Avi, pictured, faces 'a variety of sensory and social challenges', but is still 'vivacious and full of life' 'My hope is that we can spread awareness about special needs, while giving encouragement to families through the gift of professional photography,' she explained on her website. She continued: 'While their special needs are what brought them to the shoot, I wanted the images to capture their individual spirits.' Mrs. Bergeron and her husband, Chuck, also have 13other children, nine of whom are biological and five of whom are adopted. Apollo, born in June 2010, is their youngest child.","highlights":"Renee Bergeron, 38, captures children with disabilities at their most confident for her Superhero Project .\nThe Washington-based photographer's first subject was her son, Apollo, who has a feeding tube in his stomach .\nShe takes the photos free of charge to encourage families and to spread awareness .","id":"45767f990a34399076e377bc949c09aa18ca16ee"}
{"article":"A San Fransisco Giants fan beaten and left for dead outside the LA Dodgers' stadium in March 2011 has thrown the first pitch of the new baseball season . Bryan Stow \u00a0was left severely brain damaged after two men attacked him on his way to the car park following a game. The father-of-two, who had been a paramedic, was left in a medically induced coma for several months while medics waited for the swelling in his brain to subside. Brian Stow, centre pictured with his ex-wife\u00a0Jackie Kain and his two children Tyler, 14, and Tabitha, 10 . Mr Stow, pictured, was kept in a medically induced coma for several months to assist his recovery . Two men jumped \u00a0Mr Stow and kicked and punched him until he fell to the ground. They continued to punch and kick the stricken paramedic. Several of the most serious blows landed on his head causing life-changing \u00a0injuries. At the time of his injury, Mr Stow worked as a paramedic for the San Jose Giants, who are the Giants' farm team. The team promised Mr Stow and his family that he would receive the honour of pitching the first ball during the opening game of the season. Dan Oram, president of the San Jose Giant told Fox Bay News: 'It's a comeback story. Just to see what he's come through, and to be able to give him something back like this \u2014 it's just the kind of thing that resonates with everybody.' Last year, Stow shouted 'Play Ball' during a World Series match between the Giants and Kansas City Royals. Following the brutal assault, Los Angeles Superior Court awarded Mr Stow and his family $18 million against the LA Dodgers and the two men \u00a0who attacked him Louie Sanchez and Marvin Norwood. However, the family has still not received any of the cash due legal delays. Before suffering catastrophic injuries, right, Mr Stow, right, worked as a paramedic in San Jose . Louie Sanchez, left, and Marvin Norwood, right, were jailed for eight and seven years respectively .

{"article":"Getting the best price for your unwanted wares online can seem like a fine art, but researchers have found a simple trick that could see your bids soar. Economists plotted how much goods listed on eBay sold for and discovered that items with precise prices attract higher offers than those with round numbers, such as $1,000. In fact, sellers who end their price with \u201800\u2019 typically receive offers that are five to eight per cent lower than those with more specific prices. US researchers claim that exact prices of goods on eBay attract higher offers than round numbers. This chart shows that when the posted initial price is of a round number (the red dots), like $1,000, the average counteroffer is much lower than if it is a non-round number (the blue circles), like $1,079 . In terms of the study, the word 'odd' is used to represent an unusual number, and not the opposite of even. Competitive options for buyers and sellers can define a limit beyond which they will not go, but there is still a range of prices that fall within those limits, Professor of Strategic Management at University of Toronto, Joshua Gans, writes for\u00a0The Conversation. Within that range, sellers are looking for a higher price while buyers would like a lower one, so each has an incentive to signal to the other their willingness to be a tough negotiator. Sometimes, however, sellers may want to send a signal they are willing to be less tough, such as when they are keen to sell an item quickly. One method is to lower their starting price, but this isn\u2019t always desirable. Sellers on eBay who end their price with \u201800\u2019 typically receive offers for their goods that are five to eight per cent lower than those with more specific prices, such as this watch example . While eBay is used for auctions, the bulk of its business comes from 'Buy it now' sales, such as this iPhone. The study found that prices that end in '00' as above are more likely to sell quickly, but may not attract the most lucrative counter offers from sellers . Researchers from Cornell University, eBay Research Labs and the University of California, Berkeley, have addressed the problem in a new paper. Researchers from Cornell University, eBay Research Labs and the University of California looked at pricing strategies within the confines of eBay\u2019s so-called 'negotiation platform'. Most trades on the site are listed for a  \u2018Buy it now\u2019 price and the seller can give buyers the option of making them an alternative offer. For example, a seller of an iPhone may list a price of $1,000 (\u00a3660), and someone might come back with a counteroffer of $800 (\u00a3530). This could go on for about three rounds, in line with eBay rules, and could last up to a week. The study found that when the initial price is a round number, such as $1,000, the average counteroffer is between five and eight per cent lower than if it is a non-round number, like $1,079. In fact, the economists said sellers can even end up with a higher counteroffer if they list at $997 rather than $1,000. But sellers with round numbers are more likely to close a deal six to 11 days sooner, and are up to 5 per cent more likely to sell at all. Matt Backus, Thomas Blake and Steve Tadelis looked at this issue within the confines of eBay\u2019s so-called 'negotiation platform'. While some people associate eBay with auctions rather than straightforward sales, this hasn\u2019t been eBay\u2019s main business for about a decade. Instead, most trades are listed for a  \u2018Buy it now\u2019 price and the seller can give buyers the option of making them an alternative offer. For example, a seller of an iPhone may list a price of $1,000 (\u00a3660), and someone might come back with a counteroffer of $800 (\u00a3530), to which the seller could then accept or make a new offer. This could go on for about three rounds, in line with eBay rules, and could last up to a week. But the study shows that when the initial price is a round number, such as $1,000, the average counteroffer is between five and eight per cent lower than if it is a non-round number, like $1,079. In fact, the economists said sellers can even end up with a higher counteroffer if they list at $997 rather than $1,000. \u2018In other words, you are better off initially asking for a lower price if price was all you cared about,\u2019 Professor Gans writes. The researchers believe that what is going on here is \u2018cheap talk\u2019 - an easy-to-make statement that may be true or untrue with no consequences for dishonesty - and not an otherwise reliable signal. There are some sellers who don\u2019t just care about price and, absent any other way of signalling that to buyers, they set their price at a round number. The researchers applied their findings to house sales and discovered that\u00a0people looking to sell their house quickly should pick a round number, but if they're willing to wait, an odd one is more likely to get a good price . While the study is new,\u00a0Professor Gans said the technique to sell houses (a stock image is shown) as quickly as possible, or for as much money as possible, is already used by estate agents . Alternatively more patient sellers may be using non-round numbers to signal their toughness. Either way, the last two digits of the price is 'cheap talk'. But sellers with round numbers are more likely to close a deal six to 11 days sooner, and are up to 5 per cent more likely to sell at all. This is interesting because the last two digits of a price make little difference to the price, Professor Gans notes. The authors wanted to see if their analysis would work in other markets and whether they could guess what the cheap talk prices would be. They found was that while the effect they observed didn\u2019t happen for all other prices, it did arise for prices that ended in 99 cents. Prices ending in 99 cents, or 99 pence, are very common in shops and send out the same type of signal as the \u201800\u2019 prices, they said. The researchers also discovered that people looking to sell their house quickly should pick a round number, but if they are willing to wait, an odd one is more likely to get a good price \u2013 a trick estate agents already use.","highlights":"Researchers claim using exact prices when selling goods on eBay attract higher offers than round numbers .\nSellers who end prices with \u201800\u2019 typically receive offers up to 8% lower .\nHowever, goods with round numbers typically sell faster, the study claims .","id":"251bb9917a181bf47e21a7ae060fdcfe2c11f538"}
{"article":"A new HIV treatment pioneered using an antibody to attack the virus could lead to a new vaccine to prevent the infection. The first results to emerge from patient trials reveal the experimental therapy can dramatically reduce the level of virus in a patient's blood - their viral load. The scientists behind the discovery believe their findings offer new strategies for fighting or even preventing HIV infection. The antibody was designed by researchers to block the key viral protein receptor that is needed to infect human blood cells. As a result patients injected with the neutralising antibody during the trials saw a 300-fold reduction in their viral load. Scientists at the Rockefeller University in New York believe a new antibody therapy could pave the way for an HIV vaccine after clinical trials revealed the treatment resulted in a 300-fold decrease in the amount of HIV, pictured, in sufferers' blood . In a person infected with HIV, there is an ongoing battle between the virus and the body's immune system. As the body produces new antibodies that target the virus, the infection mutates to escape, managing to stay a few steps ahead. The team of scientists at Rockefeller University in New York now believe that using synthetic antibodies that attached to the surface of proteins on the outer membrane of the HIV virus, could offer an alternative treatment to the anti-retroviral drugs currently used. They hope the breakthrough will result in new therapeutic vaccines. HIV antibodies previously tested in humans had shown disappointing results, but the antibody tested at Rockefeller University belongs to a new generation of broadly neutralising antibodies that potently fight a wide range of HIV strains. Healthy gay men should be given anti-retroviral drugs to 'slash the number of cases of HIV', a groundbreaking study published earlier this year suggested. The Proud study, conducted in England, provides the first evidence that preventative HIV treatment is highly effective in a real-world setting. It showed that pre-exposure to the HIV drug Truvada can reduce the risk of infection in men-who-have-sex-with-men  by as much as 86 per cent. Previous research had suggested that preventive treatment might cut HIV infection rates but it was unclear whether such an approach would work in practice. 'One antibody alone, like one drug alone, will not be sufficient to suppress viral load for a long time because resistance will arise,' said Dr Marina Caskey, co-first author of the study. 'What's special about these antibodies is that they have activity against over 80 per cent of HIV strains and they are extremely potent.' The research showed the new antibody therapy was effective against 195 of 237 HIV strains. The immune systems of people infected with HIV naturally produce broadly neutralising antibodies in 10 to 30 per cent of sufferers, but only after several years of infection. By that time, the virus has typically evolved and mutated to a point rendering the powerful antibodies ineffective. However, by isolating and cloning these antibodies, researchers are able to harness them as therapeutic agents to use against HIV infections that have had less time to evolve. As part of the new study, uninfected and HIV-infected people were given a single dose of the antibody intravenously, and monitored for 56 days. At the highest dose level - 30mg per kilo of weight - all eight infected people treated showed up to a 300-fold decrease in the amount of HIV virus measured in their blood. Most of those participants reached their lowest viral load just one week after treatment. The study marks the first time the new generation of HIV antibodies has been tested in humans. Dr Marina Caskey, co-first author of the study, said: 'What's special about these antibodies is that they have activity against over 80 per cent of HIV strains and they are extremely potent.' (File picture) Dr Caskey said further trials could result in the antibodies being used in conjunction with existing anti-retroviral drugs to maintain better control over the infection to prevent the onset of Aids. She said antibody therapy might require treatment once every few months, compared with daily doses of antiretroviral drugs, currently the front line treatment for the virus. Besides the possibility of treatment, the study also raises hopes for an HIV vaccine. Dr Caskey said that if researchers can induce an uninfected person's immune system to generate potent antibodies such as that tested, it might be enough to block the HIV infection before it can be established. The study was published in the journal Nature.","highlights":"New antibody\u00a0blocks protein receptor needed to infect human cells .\nPatients injected saw 300-fold reduction in amount of HIV in their blood .\nScientists believe breakthrough could result in new vaccines against virus .","id":"62d20ddd57e4604f87d8f5841edb15d61cfa9901"}
{"article":"My first trip to New York was with my aunt when I was about 18 and I had been appearing in Coronation Street for about 12 months. I can remember it all so clearly. We had a lot of fun together - we went to see the musical Chicago on Broadway and did lots and lots of shopping. We returned to the city that never sleeps in January 2001, eight months before the terrible events of 9\/11, and one of the first things my boyfriend Sylvain Longchambon and I did on my latest trip was to visit the site of the World Trade Center to see the monument to those who died. It was a very poignant moment. Coronation Street star Samia Ghadie and boyfriend Sylvain Longchambon take a selfie in New York . There were hundreds of people visiting the memorial at the time but everybody was quiet and extremely respectful. Sylvain and I flew to the US from Manchester and spent four nights in the city. I love flying from Manchester if I can, not just because it's nearer to my home but because it's not so vast and sprawling as either Gatwick or Heathrow. We stayed at the Marriott where the service was fantastic - when we checked in the concierge desk wanted to know if they could help us to make bookings for shows or restaurants. And when we got to the room, we were met by a butler who immediately took away our shoes for shining - very impressive. You don't get that at a Travelodge! We had a beautiful suite on the 31st floor, giving us panoramic views of Central Park. We valued the fact that the suite had a separate lounge area, and it came in really handy because during our stay Sylvain's cousin in New York celebrated his 30th birthday, so lots of people came back to our room for a glass of bubbly. We sipped champagne as we gazed out across Manhattan - and The Rovers Return suddenly felt a very long way away. The JW Marriott Essex House as seen from Central Park, of which it boasts panoramic views . One of Samia and Sylvain's first stops was to pay their respects to those lost on September 11, 2001 . On the second night of our break, we went on the Bateaux New York cruise, which offers an unforgettable three-hour trip along the Hudson River.\u00a0We enjoyed cocktails and then a great three-course meal, and after that there was music and dancing.\u00a0You can go outside on deck where you have amazing views of Manhattan. Actually we only just made the cruise by the skin of our teeth. President Obama was in New York to address the United Nations and as we were in a taxi heading for the pier to board the cruise, we discovered that the police had closed a lot of the streets to let the President's motorcade through. With the clock ticking and our yellow cab going nowhere, we decided to get out and find the nearest subway station. Once our train reached its destination, we had to dash to get to the cruise boat, but fortunately we just made it on time. I'm so glad we did because to see Manhattan like that was an unforgettable experience. The couple, who met as partners on Dancing on Ice, enjoyed a Bateaux New York Cruise of the Hudson . The bright lights and busy traffic of Fifth Avenue which Samia covered extensively during her four-day trip . During our break, we saw most of the famous sights, including the Statue of Liberty, where we took some great pictures. We didn't manage to catch a show, though - we simply ran out of time. We wanted to have a juicy steak at a proper New York steakhouse. Friends had told us about a place called Burger Joint in Le Parker Meridien Hotel - it doesn't look very special (in fact, there's graffiti all over the walls outside) but it's reckoned to serve the best burgers in town. I have to agree they're pretty special. It was Sylvain's first visit to New York and he absolutely loved it. He also enjoyed the shopping. We must have covered the whole of Fifth Avenue during our stay, and yes, purchases were made. I have to confess I bought a few dresses. The pound was very good value against the dollar at the time, so there were a lot of bargains to be had. I calculated that many things were half the price compared with the UK - so how could I resist? While Samia shopped at famed New York stores such as Tiffany and Co,\u00a0Sylvain worked out in the gym . For bargain shopping, Samia recommends discount outlet store Century 21 for lots of major brands . Sylvain wasn't always my shopping buddy. He chose to remain at the hotel a few times and work out at the gym. So while I was at Tiffany's he was on the running machine. A crowd of\u00a0paparazzi turned out to be for Lady Gaga, but sadly a selfie with the pop star wasn't an option . Despite our world renown as an ice-dancing couple - we met while we were partners on the ITV show Dancing On Ice - we managed to resist the lure of the rink at the Rockefeller Centre. For Sylvain, ice skating is too much like work. I still skate from time to time and I have to say I'm a lot better at it than I was on the programme. I think that's because I'm just doing it for fun now and there's no pressure on me. If anybody is looking for good shopping, I can recommend BCBG - it's great for dresses, and their prices are excellent. If you're after big savings, head to Century 21, which is like an outlet store for lots of major brands. Friends had told us about it before we travelled to New York. I'm glad they did because the prices were so temptingly low. And of course I also made sure to visit the Disney Store to get presents for my little girl - we were loaded up with bags from there, much to her delight, when we returned to England. Perhaps the biggest surprise of the trip was when we had stopped to have lunch at a small Italian restaurant on Central Park near our hotel . While we were eating, we noticed a crowd gathering - with lots of paparazzi photographers. We were wondering who was going to emerge when out stepped Lady Gaga. It was the ultimate holiday treat - it was just a shame I couldn't arrange a selfie with her. That would have been the icing on the cake. American Sky (0843 636 2001) offers a three-night holiday to New York from \u00a3899pp. This includes accommodation in the JW Marriott Essex House New York on a room-only basis and return flights with British Airways from Heathrow.

{"article":"(CNN)Most days, 16-year-old Jason Zobott walks into Huntley High School in suburban Chicago around 7:30 a.m. like any high schooler might. It's what he does the rest of the day that's not so typical. Zobott is enrolled in Huntley High's blended learning program, which merges Internet-based instruction with a more traditional classroom setting. One-third of the school's 2,700 students are enrolled. In 2015, the school is working toward enrolling the majority of its students. \"Having to work online makes it really accessible to do the work that I have to get done,\" said Zobott, a top-ranked junior who balances a heavy load of extracurricular activities with schoolwork. \"I can learn on my own. I can work at the pace I want to work. And I learn the way I want to learn.\" Huntley High School students and educators often refer to the program simply as \"blended.\" It allows teachers to write the curriculum, with students giving feedback about the focus. Unlike many traditional online learning programs, students have the option of a flexible schedule during allotted blended learning days. Some days they meet with teachers, and some days they work online, according to Anne Pasco, who heads the school's educational technology efforts. \"In blended learning, we focus on the content. We don't focus on needing to cover X amount of material,\" Pasco said. \"Blended allows us to provide a stable environment that gives students the ability to spread their wings a bit, while we have the safety net of pulling them back into class if they need it.\" The \"homegrown\" program, which launched in 2011, gives students who struggle in certain content areas more one-on-one time with teachers during the school day, Pasco said. \"Before blended, that had to happen after school or before school or on Saturday or maybe not at all, because we had too many other activities that encroach upon (students') academic day,\" Pasco said. \"Now, this student can work one-on-one with that teacher during the school day.\" Teachers can monitor students' progress and track lesson plans online to see how much time students spend on a specific assignment. Teachers are allowed to restructure the class schedule based on students' needs. \"There's actually much better accountability,\" said John Burkey, the superintendent for Huntley High's school district, which includes about 9,500 students. \"Blended learning is not a panacea, and the success of the program isn't about spending a bunch of money on technology. Rather, [it's] looking at what students actually need, and building a culture of innovation to meet those needs.\" Burkey said there were plenty of questions about blended learning when it was first introduced to the Chicago district in 2011. One concern: How was the district going to pay for it? It turns out the blended learning program spends about $8,500 per student, less than the Illinois average of  $12,000 per student. \"We spend considerably less than the average school district. We don't have a lot of resources compared to many districts,\" Burkey said. \"We did not put new money into this. What we did is change the old things we were doing and changed them into new ways. It's really a change in how you think of high school. This is not a more expensive option.\" It has worked. In a study published in 2014 in eLearn magazine, 92% of students surveyed at Huntley High said that they were satisfied with the blended learning experience, and no teachers reported negative experiences with it. The school is also seeing higher standardized testing scores. \"The growth of blended certainly has corresponded with an overall rise in ACT scores,\" district spokesman Dan Armstrong said. Since blended learning was implemented, Huntley High's average composite ACT score has gone up nearly a point, from 22.1 to 23.0. For 16-year-old Zobott, the advantage is time management. Three of his courses are advanced placement. He also plays varsity basketball and club soccer and works part time. The blended learning program helps him better prioritize his busy schedule. \"Having blended gives us time to work on them, and get stuff done efficiently so we have more time during the week to do other things,\" he said. What's still left to be determined about blended learning is how well students do in college or jobs after they graduate, Burkey said. \"I think we're still in the infancy of this,\" Burkey said. \"It's still such a new thing, and we're all excited about it. My own kids are still in elementary and middle school, so they have not done blended learning yet, but they definitely will when they get to high school.\"","highlights":"Huntley High School in Huntley, Illinois, offers a blended learning program .\nIt allows students to combine online learning with in-person teacher instruction .","id":"e1297fb06c440c3fbea067aad33466fd05aef36d"}

Other stars include boy band Blue, R&B singer Jamelia, pop star Pixie Lott, jazz vocalist Gregory Porter and tenor Alfie Boe. The 1940s-themed concert will take place on Saturday 9 and will be broadcast on BBC1, hosted by Chris Evans. The singers will be joined by four Strictly Come Dancing couples and readings from Pointless host Alexander Armstrong and Absolutely Fabulous actress Jane Horrocks. The extensive commemoration is a victory for the Daily Mail which highlighted growing concerns that the anniversary risked being overshadowed by the election on May 7. Singer Dame Vera Lynn, the 98-year-old Forces\u2019 Sweetheart, was among those who called on the Government to do more to mark the occasion. It is likely to be the last major anniversary which will be attended in strength by the generation that fought at home and abroad during the war. David Cameron asked Cabinet minister William Hague in February to draw up plans for three days of national commemorations and last month Chancellor George Osborne earmarked up to \u00a32million in the Budget towards marking the event. The timing of the anniversary makes it even more of an extraordinary occasion, starting the day after a general election which is likely to result in another hung Parliament. The 1940s-themed concert will also include readings from Pointless host Alexander Armstrong (left) and Absolutely Fabulous actress Jane Horrocks (right) Ministers and their shadows are likely to gather for celebrations not knowing for sure who will be in power of the country after coalition negotiations. The three-day commemoration will begin with a Service of Remembrance on VE Day (May 8) at The Cenotaph and a national two-minute silence at 3pm, marking the moment Winston Churchill broadcast his historic speech formally announcing the end of the war in 1945. A chain of more 100 beacons will be lit across the country in the evening. Ahead of the star-studded concert on the Saturday, sports fans will honour the day with clapping and singing during fixtures and cathedrals are encouraged to ring their bells in celebration at 11am. On the Sunday there will be a Service of Thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey attended by The Queen, followed by a parade to St James\u2019s Park, where the Royal British Legion will host a lunch reception for 2,000 veterans. People across the country are encouraged to host street parties and deck out homes and community halls with bunting to recreate the celebrations of 70 years ago.

{"article":"The mother of a baby rescued after being trapped in rubble for 22 hours following the Nepal earthquake has told of the torture she endured while she heard her little boy cry for help under their flattened home. Five-month-old Sonit Awal was asleep upstairs in the family home when the quake struck, but was saved from death by a cupboard that fell over him. During frantic rescue efforts family and friends used their bare hands to try and free Sonit, but without specialist equipment it was impossible. But today mother Rasmila Awal told MailOnline of her \u2018overwhelming joy\u2019 when rescuers finally arrived and pulled Sonit from the devastation, with little more than a scratch to his face. Scroll down for video . Re-united: Mother Rasmila Awal is re-united with her baby boy who was trapped under rubble for 22 hours . Safe: Five-month-old\u00a0Sonit Awal was heard crying from undernearth the wreckage of his flattened home . Ruined: The family's four-storey house in\u00a0Bharktapur, Nepal, toppled in Saturday's devastating earthquake . Mrs Awal, 35, said: 'I am so happy to have my baby back. I'm so happy that he is alive.' Sonit was asleep in his cot upstairs when the walls of his four-storey home came crashing down around him. His parents and older sister, aged 10, were outside when the tremor struck and desperately tried to free the little boy from the wreckage, working nonstop through the night with friends and neighbours.. Rescued: Smiling Sonit Awal, aged five months, as he was pulled from the rubble of his home covered in dust . The baby boy, who emerged from the wreckage covered in dust, was miraculously found after rescue workers who heard the infant's faint cries. His mother has spoken of her 'overwhelming joy' that her baby is alive . Sanctuary: Sonit survived only because a cupboard fell on top of him protecting him from the rubble . The family are now homeless and living in a tarpulin opposite the wreckage - but are thankful they are all alive. Sonit's father Shyam Awal lost his brother Azdid in the earthquake . Rasmila Awal said she could hear her baby crying from the ruins of her home. During the 22-hours he was trapped, his mother said she could think of nothing else by trying to save the tiny infant . During the heart-breaking 22 hours that Sanit was trapped, his frantic mother said she tried everything to save her child.. She said: 'I could think of nothing else but trying to save my baby. I was very sad. I did not eat. I did not sleep. 'I could hear him crying from the ruins of our home.' However, following appeals for help, overstretched Nepalese troops arrived to finally embark on a coordinated rescue mission and rescued the boy, as dramatic pictures show. Second chance: The military search team had already scoured the area near to the child's home in Bhaktapur, Kathmandu, in the hope of finding the little boy. But they had moved on after believing he had not survived . Team work: The military team then found the young boy when they returned to the area for the second time . Relief: Sister Soniya Awal, 10, father Shyam Awal, 34, mother Rasmila Awal, 35, with baby Sonit Awal in front of their flattened house. The family have been left destitute by the natural disaster and are living on the street . Areas of Nepal have been completely flattened by the 7.8 magnitute earthquake, which has claimed the lives of more than 5,500 people across the country - and the death toll is expected to rise even further . Mr Awal, 34, a truck driver, had already lost his brother Azdid in the earthquake and said he was thankful rescue workers had managed to lift his son to safety.. He said: 'The baby was saved by a cupboard. He had been lying in his bit by the side of the bed. 'When the walls fell down they knocked a cupboard over and it became wedged by the side of the bed. My son was safe with the cupboard protecting him.' The family are now homeless and living in the street under a tarpaulin opposite their derelict house, situated in the town of Bharktapur, a 30-minute drive from the Nepalese capital of Kathmandu. Despite her family's desperate situation, Mrs Awak says she remains overjoyed that her son survived his ordeal. 'Now God has given me back my boy I want him to lead a good life and do good for others', she said. Mrs Awak said now that her child has been saved by rescuers, she wants him to 'do good' for others . Devoted: Mum Mrs Awak plants a kiss on her baby as he sleeps soundly following his traumatic ordeal . Unharmed: An solider holds baby Sonit after he was plucked to safety from his wrecked home unhurt . Sonit's older sister Soniya added: 'I am so happy my brother is safe. I love my little brother.' One of the Awal's neighbours added: 'We are all so happy that the baby was rescued. Everyone tried to help. It is a miracle he survived. God has blessed him.' The earthquake has destroyed the homes of thousands of Nepalese people, and aftershocks ensue . Rescuers were also rejoicing today after 15-year-old was pulled from the rubble after he had been trapped for five days, . Hundreds of people gathered around to see the teenager, identified by police as Pemba Tamang was pulled out from under the collapsed seven-storey Hilton Hotel building in Kathmandu, dazed and confused, and carried away on a stretcher. Pamba Tamang, 15, is taken on a stretcher after being rescued from the collapsed Hilton Hotel in Kathmandu . US workers joined Nepalese rescuers to pull out Pemba Tamang as crowds gather to watch the rescue . The teenager grimaces in pain as medics start to treat him. He was trapped under the wreckage for five days . A mother dug for hours through the rubble of her collapsed home to recover the bodies of two of her children, but miraculously found her young son had survived. Sunthalia's home was destroyed in Jharibar, a village in the hilly Gorkha district of Nepal close to the quake's epicentre. With her husband away in India and with no help in sight, she was forced to retrieve the bodies of her 10-year-old daughter and eight-year-old son herself. But she spotted her other son, aged four, still moving. 'I could see my son's fingers fluttering through the pile of stones. 'That's how I could see him and save him,' Sunthalia said, sitting listlessly on the ground, her son by her side, with the stench of dead cattle still in the ruins of her house. Nepalese rescuers, supported by an American disaster response team, had been working for hours to free him. L.B. Basnet, the police officer who crawled into a gap to reach Tamang, said he was surprisingly responsive. \u2018He thanked me when I first approached him,\u2019 said Basnet. \u2018He told me his name, his address, and I gave him some water. I assured him we were near to him.\u2019 When Tamang was lifted out, his face was covered in dust, and medics had put an IV drop into his arm. He appeared stunned, and his eyes blinked in the sunlight as workers carried him away. Andrew Olvera, an urban search and rescue member with the U.S. Agency for International Development's Disaster Assistance Response Team, said the operation to save the boyd was dangerous. Twisted ropes of steel reinforcing rods were all that stopped huge concrete slabs from falling onto the scene. Two concrete floors hung down in front of the building like curtains. 'It's risk versus gain. To save a human life, we'll risk almost anything.'.Mr Olvera added. More than 5,500 people are confirmed to have died after Saturday\u2019s mammoth earthquake, with authorities fearing that the death toll could rise to 10,000. Thousands of houses and other buildings have been destroyed, and the country has been plagued by more than 70 aftershocks in the five days since the disaster.

Homeless Nepalese are now fleeing the country in fear, with tens of thousands of people having left Kathmandu, and the government is providing a free service bus service to many destinations. The slow pace of the aid operation sparked clashes between police and desperate earthquake survivors in Kathmandu, as tens of thousands of people are sleeping rough in 16 makeshi . On Wednesday, helicopters finally brought food, temporary shelter and other aid to villages northwest of Kathmandu in the mountainous Gorkha District near the epicentre, where entire clusters of homes have been reduced to rubble.

{"article":"A woman who lost more than three stone in six months by using gastric band hypnosis was mistaken for her husband's new lover by his amazed colleagues. Andrea Lindsay, 43, from Prescot, Merseyside, transformed her appearance leaving her almost unrecognisable to friends and family. The mother-of-one shed more than three stone using an hypnosis app and dropped from a size 18 to a size ten to 12 in half a year. Andrea Lindsay, 43, from Prescot, Merseyside,\u00a0shed more than three stone using an hypnosis app . Andrea hit her target weight in December 2014, shrinking from 14st to around 10st 5lb, before dying her bright blonde locks dark brown. And the bank worker received a curious compliment when her husband's colleagues thought Robbie had traded his wife in for a younger, slimmer model at a Christmas party when they failed to recognise her. Andrea said: 'I hit my target weight in December and we went to my husband's work party. A couple we knew walked in so I waved and said hello to them but they seemed really off with me. 'I thought they must have had an argument or something but we found out later that they didn't recognise me - they thought Rob had traded me in for a newer model. 'After losing the weight and dying my hair, they just didn't recognise me and thought that Rob had brought another woman with him! 'They had no idea who I was and had asked their friends where Andrea from last year was and why I wasn't with Rob.' Andrea, pictured here with her husband Robbie, says she'd tried every fad diet . After her transformation\u00a0her husband's colleagues thought Robbie had traded his wife in for a younger, slimmer model at a Christmas party . 'Andrea says: 'People I have known for years have walked past me in the street as well and just ignored me. I didn't even think I looked that different.' The brunette says she has struggled with her weight all her life and says she'd tried every fad diet with little success ever since she reached a size 16\/18 in her early teens. Andrea's new diet plan . Breakfast: Porridge . Lunch: Soup and a sandwich . Tea: Chilli with rice, cheese, and bread . Mid-morning: (as soon as I feel hungry) bowl of soup or a salad . Evening (as soon as I feel hungry) - a small bowl of chilli with cheese, bread or salad . But after she discovered Easy Loss' Virtual Gastric Band - Lose Weight Fast app, she has never looked back and said she still listens to the hypnosis sessions twice a day. The \u00a34.99 app is designed to teach people to use their common sense when it comes to eating, rather than sticking to rules and restrictions, and just eating when they are hungry. Andrea said: 'As far back as I can remember, I have been overweight. Andrea says she'd had little success with weight loss ever since she reached a size 16\/18 in her teens . But seeing as she never had any health issues she didn't really do anything about her weight . She says she always said she never wanted to be fat and 40, but got to 43 and was 'still fat' 'I tried absolutely everything - fad diets, cutting out food - but nothing ever worked. I would stick at it for a few weeks then just lose interest. There were too many rules and restrictions. 'I think because I never had any health issues I didn't really do anything about it. I always said I never wanted to be fat and 40, but I got to 43 and was still fat. 'It wasn't until I started doing hot yoga that I realised I was dissatisfied with myself, so I started looking for something to help me relax and that is when I found Easy Loss - it was just a complete fluke.' Andrea says: 'The ethos of my new lifestyle is that I don't stick to traditional meal times! I eat whenever I'm hungry, as soon as I'm hungry and stop eating as soon as I'm no longer hungry. 'If we went out for breakfast before I would have a fry up, now I have something lighter like Eggs Benedict.' Andrea is now preparing for a luxury two week getaway with husband Robbie, 45, to Mexico, and can't wait to show off her new bikini body on the beach. She said: 'I go away on Saturday and this is the first time I have actually felt body confident. I've spent \u00a3700 on a new holiday wardrobe, and I can't wait to wear everything. 'I got my old holiday clothes out and everything was just falling off me - I just can't believe now that I was ever that big. The difference is massive. After she started doing hot yoga she realised she was dissatisfied and that is when she found Easy Loss . 'I have three younger sisters and I have always been the fat one. They always shared each other's clothes and I could never do that, until now. They are amazed at the difference too. 'Since Easy Loss I eat a better balance and variety of food, a lot healthier. But we still have takeaways on a Friday, I don't feel deprived at all. 'It has changed my mind-set completely, it isn't a weight loss programme more a common sense set of guidelines to follow. My husband has started listening to it now as well.' Sue Peckham, co-creator of Virtual Gastric Band - Lose Weight Fast app said: 'Andrea has done so well with our app and we're all thrilled for her. She is a real inspiration and a Gold Member of our Easyloss Facebook Group. 'Her support and advice is a great help and really appreciated by other group members. We're really grateful for all she does to help other app users to achieve their weight loss goals.' The \u00a34.99 app is designed to teach people to use their common sense when it comes to eating .

{"article":"Toni Duggan says free-scoring England will fear nobody at this summer's World Cup finals as they aim to make history by winning their first major tournament. Having recovered from a serious knee injury earlier in the year, the Manchester City striker is working hard to rediscover her best form ahead of the finals in Canada in June. England have never progressed beyond the quarter-finals in their three previous World Cup appearances but Duggan, who has 11 goals in 16 games for her country, is convinced Mark Sampson's team can go further this time. England forward Toni Duggan holds aloft the St George's flag as part of the 'Road to Canada' campaign . Duggan pictured in action for the England team during a match earlier this season . She told Sportsmail: 'We don't fear anyone, we have lots of belief. We've come up against the likes of Germany, the USA and Brazil before and one of our aims is to overcome the mental block we seem to get at the quarter-final stage. 'We play with freedom, we have no fear and we enjoy expressing ourselves. I don't think you've seen the best of England yet and we have so many different goalscorers. We're getting better all the time.' St George's Day allows Duggan the opportunity to reflect on the achievements of her England career so far, with highlights including hat-tricks for the Three Lions against Turkey and Montenegro in qualification for the finals. In all, she found the net on 10 occasions as England coasted through their qualification group with 10 wins from 10 in the perfect start to Sampson's tenure after he replaced Hope Powell following the 2013 European Championships. In the process, England scored a remarkable 52 goals and the task now is to translate that prolific scoring form into the tournament itself. Duggan said: 'It was the perfect qualfying campaign for us, the whole team pulled together and we were able to get 10 wins out of 10. Mark Sampson came in as coach and took everything in his stride. 'It was nice to score 10 goals myself and that included my first hat-trick, against Turkey, which was a nice feeling. Duggan chases for the ball during a Women's Super League match with former club Everton . The 23-year-old gained previous tournament experience with England at the 2013 European Championships . 'We conceded just the one goal, which is obviously almost perfect and I think we showed that we have strength in the squad from No 1 to No 23 and that's what you need at a World Cup.' But just as her thoughts were starting to turn towards the new Women's Super League season and the World Cup in Canada beyond, Duggan suffered the worst injury of her career. The knee problem kept her on the sidelines for eight weeks, required surgery and ruined pre-season plans. It left Duggan needing to prove her form and fitness to the England management team all over again. She said: 'The timing was very unfortunate, coming in a World Cup year. It really killed my confidence and was difficult to deal with because it was the first time. 'I needed major surgery and missed pre-season but I knew it was going to be a big year for both Manchester City and England and it has made me appreicate my time on the pitch a little more. 'I'd like to think I'm good enough to make the World Cup squad but Mark will definitely have a selection headache because it is such a good group. But I will put in the hard work and hopefully will get in.' She made her Three Lions return in the recent friendly with China, playing the last half-hour of a confidence-boosting 2-1 success on her home ground of Manchester City's Academy Stadium. Duggan scored 10 times in a World Cup qualification campaign that saw England with a 100 per cent record . Manchester City are among the favourites for the Women's Super League title this year . June 9 France . June 13 Mexico . June 17 Colombia . Hailing from Liverpool, Duggan started out at Everton Ladies, working her way through the youth ranks and into the senior side during the 2007-08 season. She didn't look back, becoming a first-team regular and earning a first England cap in September 2012 having gained tournament experience at under 19 and under 20 level. Duggan was then signed by City in 2013 as they started out in the Women's Super League. They announced themselves as a force in the game by winning the Continental Cup and are set to challenge for the WSL title this year. Duggan said: 'We won the Continental Cup last season and hopefully we can continue that in the Super League this year. We need to be more consistent over a longer period. 'The title race is going to be a close one but we've made a good start and are positive about our chances. 'We have a winning mentality at City that goes hand-in-hand with England. It's an honour to play for them and we have a fantastic opportunity to go out and win trophies.' On her journey with England, which she hopes will inspire the next generation, Duggan adds: 'It is a dream come true for me to represent my country. 'To be in the first team for England hopefully to be on the verge of a World Cup call-up. As a kid, I didn't even know there was an England team for women so wearing that shirt, whether it's your first cap or your 25th, is amazing.'

Kevin Cave caught the incident on video that he posted on his Reddit page. It has already been viewed more than 1 million times. Cave said when his family first arrived at Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo gorilla exhibit, he noticed one of the gorillas had a cut below his eye that was \"bleeding a little bit.\" He said he overheard a couple of zookeepers say the gorillas had been fighting with one another. Then the gorilla -- named Kijoto -- charged toward the window and smacked into it, he said. The leap sent the family and other patrons running, but Cave said when he looked back, \"it wasn't as bad as we thought it was.\" Dan Cassidy with the Henry Doorly Zoo said he's been surprised by the attention since he considered the whole thing a \"nonevent.\" The group of male gorillas is known to have occasional skirmishes. \"They show how tough they are by pounding on the wall and the windows,\" Cassidy said. Even with the crack, the public was never in danger, he said, because the window has multiple layers of both glass and acrylic. Kijoto is a 20-year-old western lowland gorilla, according to a release on the zoo's website. He weighs 375 pounds.","highlights":"Gorilla leaps toward exhibit window and hits it, sending family running.\nZoo says patrons were never in danger.","id":"dbce61d253b9e770529817b484aeb8b0cca76a73"}
{"article":"Dementia could soon be treated with a 'brain pacemaker' inserted directly into the skull, according to new research. Scientists have shown that using deep brain stimulation (DBS), a technique already used to treat Parkinson's disease, can boost memory by causing new brain cells to be formed. A 'pacemaker' fitted with electrodes is inserted into the brain through holes drilled in the skull. Deep brain stimulation is already used to treat Parkinson's, but now researchers now believe it could be used to improve brain function and ward off diseases such as dementia (file image) Experiments on rats found the therapy improved their powers of recall, and it is hoped the same will apply to humans. The device sends electrical impulses to specific parts of the brain and has also been shown to provide benefits for a range of conditions including chronic pain, major depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. The device was implanted into middle aged rats, sending out minute electrical impulses, and the study found the animals performed better in memory tests compared to those who had not been stimulated, even after 24 hours. Professor Ajai Vyas, of Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, said: 'Extensive studies have shown that rats' brains and memory systems are very similar to humans. 'The electrodes are harmless to the rats, as they go on to live normally and fulfil their regular adult lifespan of around 22 months.' DBS is a surgical procedure that has become an established NHS treatment  for Parkinson's sufferers whose condition does not respond to drugs. Tests on lab mice showed improved memory within just 24 hours, while the rodents' life-spans were unaffected (file image) Now the new research, published in the journal eLife, has discovered it could also be used to enhance the growth of brain cells which relieves the harmful effects of dementia related conditions and improves short and long term memory. It found new brain cells, or neurons, can be formed by stimulating the front part of the brain known as the prefrontal cortex which is involved in memory retention using minute amounts of electricity. The increase in brain cells reduces anxiety and depression, promotes improved learning, and boosts overall memory formation and retention. Prof Vyas said: 'The findings from the research clearly show the potential of enhancing the growth of brain cells using deep brain stimulation. 'Around 60 per cent of patients do not respond to regular anti depressant treatments and our research opens new doors for more effective treatment options.' Prof Lim Lee Wei, of Sunway University, Malaysia, who worked on the project while he was at Nanyang Technological University, said DBS brings multiple benefits. He said: 'No negative effects have been reported in such prefrontal cortex stimulation in humans and studies have shown that stimulation also produces anti depression effects and reduces anxiety. 'Memory loss in older people is not only a serious and widespread problem, but signifies a key symptom of dementia. 'At least one in 10 people aged 60 and above in Singapore suffer from dementia and this breakthrough could pave the way towards improved treatments for patients.' For decades, scientists have been finding ways to generate brain cells to treat brain trauma and injury, and age related diseases such as dementia. As part of a natural cycle, brain cells constantly die and get replaced by new ones. The area of the brain responsible for generating new brain cells is known as the hippocampus, which is also involved in memory forming, organising and retention. By stimulating the prefrontal cortex, new brain cells are formed in the hippocampus although it had not been directly stimulated.","highlights":"Deep brain stimulation involves implanting electrodes inside the skull .\nTechnique is already used to help treat diseases such as Parkinson's .\nScientists think it could help delay dementia by replenishing brain cells .","id":"fa2ba5ddb671a58fbb631bac963cb5bd159f2189"}
{"article":"Pope Francis urged the international community not to 'look the other way' and act over the killings of Christians around the globe, during his Easter Monday address. Speaking to tourists and Catholic pilgrims in St Peter's Square, the pontiff asked for 'tangible help' from communities all over the world for Christians persecuted because of their faith - but stopped short of suggesting what actions should be taken. The Pope, aged 78, has been increasingly vocal about the fate of Christians being targeted by Islamic extremists in parts of the Middle East, Africa and Asia. A gust of wind blows as Pope Francis gives his Easter Monday address. He urged the international community not to 'look the other way' as Christians across the world face violence and attacks because of their religion . Hundreds of Catholic pilgrims and tourists stood in St Peter's Square in Vatican City to listen to the Pope speak on Easter Monday. He urged for 'tangible help' to Christians being persecuted around the globe . The latest address follows his speech on Easter Sunday, where he said he was praying for the victims of armed conflict, including the students massacred by Somali gunmen at a university in Kenya. He was also building on his Good Friday denunciation of what he then called 'complicit silence' about the targeting of Christians. 'They are our martyrs of today, and they are many. We can say that they are more numerous than in the first centuries', Pope Francis said. During his address on Monday he praised those who were 'sensitizing public opinion about the persecution of Christians in the world' Pope Francis reaches out to bless the crowd gathered below. He said the international community must not stand 'mute' as Christians having their basic human rights taken away because of their faith . The reflection of the Vatican, where Pope Francis gave his speech, can bee seen in this woman's sunglasses as she films the event. Hundreds flocked to the Holy See of the Catholic church in Rome for the address . Speaking from the window of the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican, Pope Francis asked for 'concrete participation and tangible help in defense and protection of our brothers and our sisters, who are persecuted, exiled, slain, beheaded, solely for being Christian.' He added: 'I hope that the international community doesn't stand mute and inert before such unacceptable crimes, which constitute a worrisome erosion of the most elementary human rights. I truly hope that the international community doesn't look the other way.' On Thursday militant Islamist group al-Shabab attacked the Garissa University, killing 148 people. Survivors said the militants spared Muslim students but taunted Christian and Jewish students before killing them. Pope Francis has used his Easter addresses to urge greater protection for Christian communities, after Christian students were killed in an attack on a Kenyan university by militant Islamist group al-Shabab . In Iraq and Syria, the advance of Islamic State group fighters has forced members of ancient Christian communities to flee their homes. Statistics from the International Society for Human Rights show Christians are the victims of 80 per cent of all acts of religious discrimination in the world today. The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby hailed the victims of the Kenyan university massacre during his Easter Sunday sermon, adding that Christians must resist without violence the persecution they suffer. This is Pope Francis' third Easter since he was elected in 2011 as the head of the Catholic Church, which has 1.2 billion members worldwide.","highlights":"Pope Francis says Christians coming under increasing number of attacks .\nAsked for 'tangible help' for those 'persecuted solely for being Christian'\nSpeech follows attack on Kenyan university which left 148 students dead .","id":"749d6dfbc0bb0097b0293cd8a623d60b1d0a0f62"}
{"article":"A new Reddit thread is offering some fascinating insights into the strange lives of men who have purchased mail-order brides. The discussion, which focuses on brides from Russia and the Philippines and has so far garnered more than 10,000 comments, asked users to spill the beans on what 'surprised' them the most when they started living with their spouses. '[She] spoke about sex the same way she spoke about housework,' wrote one, while another confessed: 'I could always tell she was uncomfortable. It seemed like she was just doing a job.' Ruse awakening: The Reddit thread asked users to spill the beans on what 'surprised' them the most when they started living with their spouses . One user described the process of 'ordering' a bride from Russia or the Philippines, where thousands of women are desperate to start a new life for themselves in Europe and the US. The fee to find a bride this way, according to this user, costs between $10,000 (\u00a36,500) and $15,000 (\u00a39,800), although others have said they paid as much as $50,000 (\u00a332,700). 'Since a large amount of these foreign brides do not speak English, a person must hire a translator for phone and other forms of correspondence,' he explains. 'When a man becomes serious about a few women, he will want to purchase the girl\u2019s address to send letters and gifts. 'Addresses usually will cost between $10 [\u00a36.50] and $15 [\u00a39.80}. A translator will also be needed for these letters which will normally add another $10  to $15 a letter.' Several people submitted stories not about themselves but people they know, and almost all of them noted that the men ordered their brides because they struggled socially. Booming: Russianbrides.com (pictured) now boasts an online community of more than one million hopefuls . Face value: Once a man has zeroed in on a woman he likes, he generally needs to hire a translator to communicate with her . 'My father brought my mum at an auction in Thailand a LONG time ago, it's pretty weird and he was kinda a creepy guy so basically what you'd expect,' one stated. 'I mean there's a reason these kinds of guys end up getting mail-ordered brides. Sometimes they are just super awkward, other times they are total d-bags,' another wrote. Several men, who had presumably since split with their mail-order brides, noted that the sexual chemistry was lacking. 'She would cook, clean, offer sex, whatever,' one wrote. 'Pretty much what you want from your wife. But the passion, emotion, warmth, everything that makes a marriage actually work was lacking. 'You could liken it to a gold digger but it was much worse. At least with a gold digger it isn\u2019t painfully obvious, and you might actually convince yourself she likes some aspect of you.' Another found the opposite. 'The only thing I can think of is that she is very open about sexuality compared to most girls,' wrote one man, a 35-year-old who said he had cerebral palsy, and spent $22,000 [\u00a314,395] to secure his bride. Just a chore: '[She] spoke about sex the same way she spoke about housework,' wrote one submitter . One user wrote: 'She seemed under the impression that a man was to be kept like a king and she was there for food and sex.' But then added: 'The biggest surprise was finding out that when his \"wife\" was sending money \"back home to her family\", it was to her husband (not \"ex\") and kids in the Philippines.' Amid all the stories about disappointed grooms, there were a few sad accounts regarding the brides. One user wrote of a friend's mail-order wife: '[She] had a ridiculous amount of humidifiers in the home so that it could be more like where she came from. All she did was to sit in a chair staring at the wall looking very depressed.' Another commented: 'There's way too many cases in which those girls looking for a better life end up in bad stories of domestic abuse and even murder when those guys start realizing that the girls are way out of their league and they start to meet new people and making friends.' Regardless of where you stand, the mail-order business is booming - Russianbrides.com now boasts an online community of more than one million hopefuls - \u00a0and shows no sign of slowing down.","highlights":"A new Reddit thread asked users to submit their experiences .\nMany men were disappointed with their mail-order brides .\nMeeting a woman this way can cost up to $50,000 (\u00a332,700) or more .","id":"834472818cb0e94b8926a0282e695c3bc4f96a29"}

Prince George's brother or sister could be called Sam - after the jockey that helped the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge rekindle their romance. Bookmakers have slashed odds on the name Sam - which could be used for Samuel or Samantha - being chosen for the name of the second royal baby. It follows the success of part-time jockey and the Duchess of Cambridge's close friend Sam Waley-Cohen at Aintree this weekend. The 33-year-old amateur jockey was once dubbed 'The Royal Matchmaker' after he helped the couple rekindle their romance during their brief split in 2007. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have publicly insisted that even they do not know what sex their second child will be. Ladbrokes confirmed they received a recent flurry of bets following Mr Waley Cohen's high-profile win on Radjhani Express on Friday in Aintree's Crabbies Topham Chase - prompting their odds to tumble from 66\/1 to 20\/1. David Williams of Ladbrokes said: 'With Sam Waley-Cohen's close links to the Royals it seems punters are putting two and two together and coming up with Sam as their answer for the baby's name.' Simon Clare, from bookmakers Coral, confirmed they too have had no choice but reduce their odds on 'Sam' in recent days because of the popularity of the name. He explained: 'We have slashed his odds from 66\/1 to 40\/1 . 'Given how close the Duchess of Cambridge is to Sam Waley-Cohen we are also seeing money for Sam or Samuel at 150\/1 and Samantha at 200\/1 to be their second baby's name.' Scroll down for video . The new prince or princess will be fourth in line to the throne but, unlike Prince George, he or she is not expected to rule as sovereign. The baby will be the Queen's fifth great-grandchild. Alice is still the favourite at 3\/1 followed closely by Elizabeth and Charlotte at 5\/1 and 6\/1 respectively, according to Ladbrokes on Sunday afternoon. At the moment odds have been slashed for female names, because of widespread speculation that the Duchess of Cambridge will give birth to a sister for Prince George. The Duchess of Cambridge is expected to give birth later this month, with a rumoured due date of April 25 . Mr Waley-Cohen, pictured in 2014, rode to success at Aintree on Friday and in the Grand National . Mr Waley-Cohen, who has been a close confidante of the Duchess of Cambridge for years, rode Oscar Time to 15th place in yesterday's Grand National. In 2011 he was invited to the couple's Westminster Abbey wedding.\u00a0And in 2012 Mr Waley-Cohen- whose relatives include Shell Oil founder, the 3rd Viscount Bearsted - made the Duchess guest of honour at his nuptials to party-organiser Bella Ballin. Mr Waley-Cohen, a part-time jump-jockey and healthcare businessman, won the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 2010 on 'Long Run' The royal baby is expected to arrive later this month. There is speculation the Cambridges' second born might arrive on the Queen's birthday on April 21 or even the Duke and Duchess' fourth wedding anniversary on April 29. Other reports suggest the due date could be April 25. The Duchess of Cambridge is to return to the Lindo wing at St Mary's Hospital in London to give birth. as she did with Prince George (pictured) That date would tally with the fact that the Duchess' final public engagements before she gives birth were carried out on March 27 in South London, suggesting late April is more likely than mid-April. The Duchess' second pregnancy was announced on September 8 when she was thought to be just six weeks pregnant. She has been staying at the couple's new country home in Norfolk, Anmer Hall. But she is expected to return to London soon as she intends to give birth at the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital, where a natural birth costs up to \u00a310,000.

{"article":"The hit US TV series House of Cards features Francis Underwood, played by Kevin Spacey, and his wife Claire, played by Robin Wright . So here\u2019s the deal.\u00a0Step one: book a private dining room at Washington\u2019s Capital Grille. Step two: invite your political enemies to lunch. Step three: ask the waiter for an extra-sharp steak knife. Lunch is never just lunch when you\u2019re dining in the shadow of Capitol Hill. It\u2019s an exercise in power-broking and political assassination. I\u2019d come to Washington to learn some tricks from House Of Cards \u2013the hit US political TV series starring Kevin Spacey as Francis Underwood \u2013 on how best to neutralise your opponents. America\u2019s capital is filled with Underwood wannabes: senators and governors with razor tongues and egos to match. The Capital Grille is a favoured venue for political plots. With crisply starched linen, glittering candlesticks and heavy silver cutlery, the decor suggests an atmosphere of civility and restraint, while the stuffed heads of deer and bison are redolent of a New England country mansion. But there\u2019s a subtext to those severed heads: this is a place where the hunt always ends in a kill. I\u2019ve been brought here by Alicia Malone, whose job is to sell Washington to foreign visitors. The seat of the United States Congress is in the United States Capitol, atop Capitol Hill in Washington . I ask if the city really functions as darkly as it does in House Of Cards. She swings around in her chair and points towards a closed door. \u2018That\u2019s one of the private rooms,\u2019 she says. \u2018And there\u2019s a senator hosting a political lunch in there right now.\u2019 My imagination goes into overdrive. A corrupt governor. A call-girl. A line of cocaine. If the host was Underwood, he\u2019d certainly be exploiting it for political gain. Much of the action in House Of Cards takes place on Capitol Hill, home to the Senate and the House of Representatives. There are tours of the vast building and it\u2019s a good introduction to how the city ticks. My guide is Martin, a preppy student with a smile like Matt Damon\u2019s. The Lincoln Memorial was built to honour the 16th president of the United States, Abraham Lincoln . He whisks me around the gilded splendour of the old Senate, as well as the still-functioning chamber of the new. It\u2019s easy to forget you\u2019re touring a working political building \u2013 a place where senators, advisers and policy wonks battle for influence. For more than two centuries, arm-twisting and bullying has been the reality of American politics. Even the hallowed founding fathers relied on strong-arm tactics to pass legislation. As Martin spills stories of feuds and political assassinations, I realise that men like Underwood have been controlling Washington ever since the birth of America. Giles Milton pictured at the Capital Grille . Some of those early politicians \u2013 such as the seventh President, Andrew Jackson \u2013 were so fiery that they make the players in the TV series look like amateurs. President Jackson\u2019s solution to every problem was to fight a duel: Martin jokes that his body was so full of lead-shot that these days he wouldn\u2019t get through the metal-detectors at the entrance to the Capitol building. Washington was chosen as America\u2019s new capital in 1790 after months of haggling and compromise. The states of Maryland and Virginia each agreed to donate land in order that one small area \u2013 the District of Columbia (DC) \u2013 could be placed under the exclusive jurisdiction of Congress. This holds true to this day. Despite its status, the city faces a struggle to lure tourists away from New York. Yet Washington has many more public monuments than its rival, including the two biggest hits in America: the White House (tours have to be reserved in advance) and the National Mall, home to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial. The latter is a vast statue built to honour Abraham Lincoln, America\u2019s 16th President and considered by many to have been its greatest. US president Barack Obama (left) pays for his lunch at Ben's Chili Bowl restaurant (right) in 2009 . Every politician needs to connect with his or her voters: Frank Underwood and Barack Obama are no exception. Underwood\u2019s way of connecting is to go to Freddy\u2019s BBQ Joint and eat ribs. When Obama wants to connect, he heads 12 blocks north from the White House to the intersection of 14th Street and U Street. This rough-and-ready area, just below Columbia Heights, has been transformed into a popular shabby-chic district in recent years. More famously, it\u2019s home to Ben\u2019s Chili Bowl, an all-American burger and hot-dog joint and a favourite of Obama. You don\u2019t come here for gastro-cuisine. Ben\u2019s serves junk food with a spicy twist. A plastic sign proclaims it to be \u2018a Washington landmark\u2019. At 10am it\u2019s doing a brisk trade in chilli-dogs dripping with cholesterol \u2013 but they certainly kick-start the morning. The Smithsonian Museum of Natural History. The main building on the National Mall contains 1.5 million square feet of space and altogether is the size of 18 football fields . Washington\u2019s biggest draw is resolutely apolitical: the Smithsonian is one of the greatest museum complexes in the world. It has it all, from Rembrandts to rockets, along with stuffed elephants and tribal headgear. Best of all, James Smithson\u2019s legacy decreed that all the museums established with his legacy must always be free, including the Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo. Sandwiched between the many museums of the Smithsonian is one of the city\u2019s least likely attractions. The US National Archives viewed from the Smithsonian National Sculpture Garden . The National Archives is a classical beast of a building that displays an early copy of the Magna Carta (which inspired the authors of the constitution), daguerreotypes of cowboy pioneers in the Wild West and terrifying tracts written by the Ku Klux Klan. The stars of the show are found in the Rotunda, which houses the three documents that defined America \u2013 the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Yellowing, faded and scarcely legible, they are powerfully emotive symbols of the American dream. All the hopes of early America are contained in these three pieces of parchment. \u2018We the People of the United States\u2019 are the opening words of the Constitution, a text that extols the lofty principles of justice, liberty and welfare \u2013 universally ignored by the characters in House Of Cards and, alas, by a large number of flesh-and-blood politicians.

{"article":"His primary job is to keep opposition strikers at bay, but that hasn't stopped John Terry from showing them the art of finishing too. The Chelsea captain scored his side's second goal in their 3-1 win away at Leicester on Wednesday night - as the Blues close in on their fourth Premier League title. The 34-year-old's close-range effort took his tally for the season to seven in all competitions - making him the club's joint third-highest goalscorer. John Terry was on hand to prod home from close range against Leicester on Wednesday night . Terry's strike at the King Power Stadium was his seventh goal in all competitions for Chelsea this season . Terry sits alongside strikers Loic Remy and Didier Drogba with seven goals apiece as well as attacking midfielder Oscar. Only star striker Diego Costa (20 goals) and PFA Player of the Year Eden Hazard (18) have more for Jose Mourinho's side this campaign. The centre back's ability to score is a skill that compares him favourably to the firepower among other teams in and around the top seven of the table. At Manchester City, former Chelsea team-mate Frank Lampard also has seven goals in all competitions this season - but Terry has fared better than forwards Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic who have only found the back of the net six and five times respectively. On the other side of Manchester, much has been made of the malaise of on loan United striker Radamel Falcao. The 29-year-old has endured a tough season in England and this has been reflected by his poor tally of four goals in all competitions. Terry's goal return is better than Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko - who has six goals for the season . Radamel Falcao has endured a difficult season on loan at Manchester United - scoring only four goals . Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck (centre) has scored only one more goal than Terry this season . Liverpool forward Mario Balotelli (left) and Tottenham's Roberto Soldado have both struggled in front of goal . Danny Welbeck, who left United for Arsenal last summer, hasn't fared much better too - having scored eight goals in all competitions for the Gunners. North London rivals Tottenham have relied heavily upon on the goals of Harry Kane and without his productivity Mauricio Pochettino would have had to call upon four-goal man Roberto Soldado and Emmanuel Adebayor who has only scored twice. Liverpool's struggle for goals has been highlighted by the fact that Raheem Sterling has been deployed in attack by manager Brendan Rodgers this season. First-choice forward Daniel Sturridge has scored only five goals in a campaign which has been beset by injuries. Coupled with that, summer signings Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert have failed to replace the void left by Luis Suarez - with the pair having scored four and three goals apiece. Terry's impressive goal return is even impressive when you look at the figures of Lambert's former club Southampton, where Saints forward Graziano Pelle (15) is their only player to have scored more than the former England international. The south coast club's next highest marksman is Sadio Mane with six then Shane Long with five. Southampton striker Graziano Pelle (left) has scored 15 goals in all competitions for the club this season . Chelsea's No 26 is vying with team-mate Branislav Ivanovic and United's Chris Smalling as this season's highest-scoring Premier League defender. The trio all have four goals in England's top-tier this season - three behind Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel's feat 12 months ago. Despite their impressive return, the triumvirate have a long way to go to match Julian Dicks' record. The West Ham legend netted 10 goals during the 1995-96 season as the Hammers finished 10th in the table with 51 points after the 38-game season.

{"article":"SeaWorld has been accused of drugging killer whales, painting over their injuries and keeping them in pools so shallow they get sunburned. A lawsuit filed by\u00a0Joyce Kuhl, a grandmother from South Carolina who visited the Orlando park in 2013, claims orcas are being kept in 8ft deep holding pools, leaving the marine animals 'essentially roasting'. In her suit, Ms Kuhl\u00a0alleges that the resulting burns are so bad staff are forced to paint the orcas with black zinc oxide to disguise the injuries . Scroll down for video . Accusations: A lawsuit claims the orcas at SeaWorld Orlando are being kept in shallow holding pools which give them such bad sunburns staff are forced to paint them to disguise the injuries . Ms Kuhl wants to have her $97 ticket reimbursed, as well as tickets for millions of other visitors who have been to the park in the past four years, accusing SeaWorld of 'false, misleading and deceptive business practices,' the Orlando Sentinel reports. In her suit she also alleges that the giant marine mammals are being deprived of food for days while being trained to perform at SeaWorld, and that the chlorine used in their tanks is 'many times stronger than household bleach'. Kuhl's suit details allegations of forced breeding, incestuous inbreeding and whales kept together in ways that make them hyper-aggressive so that they fight and inflict deep gashes on each other. She claims to have witnessed whales 'banging their heads against their tanks and grinding their teeth on the walls, floors and bars until their teeth break or are worn to the pulp, allegedly because of boredom, frustration and ennui,'\u00a0The Guardian reports. This is the second lawsuit against SeaWorld in less than one month, with similar filed in California which accuse the company of 'misleading the public' by claiming that their killer whales are happy. The lawsuit also alleges that the giant marine mammals are being deprived of food for days while being trained to perform at SeaWorld . This follows a failed social media campaign last month, during which SeaWorld organised a Q&A on Twitter using the hashtag #AskSeaWorld. Instead of the intended questions about opening hours, animals and attractions, the company was asked if their 'tanks were filled with orca tears'. Many people used the opportunity to express their anger at the company and questioned its ethics for keeping killer whales and other animals in captivity, often in solitary confinement. User @AshleeCheese_ tweeted: 'Why do you keep breeding whales when you barely have enough room for one? #AskSeaWorld.' Another campaigner @Jennyleeisme followed suit and tweeted: 'Do you really believe Shamu Stadium is the most advanced marine mammal habitat? Have you seen the ocean? #AskSeaWorld.' Animal rights group PETA was quick to make its views known, tweeting a series of photographs of the marine creatures, reportedly showing signs of their distress. The backlash comes two years after the release of the documentary BlackFish, which questioned the conditions orcas were kept in following killer whale Tilikum's fatal attack on trainer Dawn Brancheau at SeaWorld Orlando in 2010. The 80-minute film, which premiered at Sundance in 2013, prompted questions about the ethics of keeping the large mammals in tanks. Since its release, attendance has declined at the company's parks in Orlando, San Diego, California and San Antonio, Texas. SeaWorld's stock value has also plummeted. To counter the backlash, the firm, which has participated in animal rescue programs for more than 50 years, has announced plans to nearly double the size of its orca enclosures in upcoming years. Recent figures show attendance to the company's 11 parks between October and December 2014 fell 2.2 percent to 4.4 million from 4.5 million in the same period a year ago. Attendance fell 4.3 percent during the entire year to 22.4million from 23.4million in 2013. During the fourth quarter last year, the company reported a loss of $25.4million, compared with a loss of $13million in the same period a year before.","highlights":"SeaWorld Florida accused of drugging its\u00a0performing\u00a0killer whales .\nLawsuit alleges park's pools are so shallow the orcas get sunburned .\nAccuse staff of painting over killer whales' injuries and burns .\nClaims marine park use chlorine 'many times stronger than bleach'","id":"f2aaa1cff120a48be3da0ab0882b982051a9e075"}

{"article":"An 82-year-old woman died after sitting in the same chair in her South Carolina home for six months, authorities have said. Barbara Anne Beam was being looked after by her elderly sister and nephew when she passed away in her bedroom in Greenville on January 2. The coroner's office found she died from a blood clot in her lung and ruled that her death was homicide by neglect. Prosecutors are now deciding whether to charge the family members. Officers were called to the home on January 2 and the smell was so bad that some of the first firefighters on the scene set up a fan by the door. Scene: Barbara Beam died in her South Carolina home in January after sitting for six months and prosecutors are considering charges against her caretakers. The identity of the woman pictured is not known . An officer noticed ulcers on the back of the 200-pound woman's legs and that body fluids were staining the sunken seat of her chair, according to the police report. The sister told the officer that Beam 'stays in the chair located in the bedroom and that she had not moved out of the chair for approximately six months,' according to a police report. She added that, a few hours before her sister's death, Beam refused to eat and they watched a soap opera together in her bedroom before she went to the kitchen. When she returned, Beam was slumped in her chair and the sister and nephew could find no pulse. When paramedics took Beam out of the chair and put her on the floor, her legs were still bent in a sitting position when the officer arrived. She was not wearing pants, according to the report. When she died, she also had deep vein thrombosis, which are clots caused by sitting for long periods of time, and a serious infection that started in her kidneys, the coroner's office said. 'The decedent had significant ulcerations and wounds - pressure ulcers, essentially - on her legs from prolonged inactivity and prolonged time spent in a chair,' Dr. James Fulcher, the deputy medical examiner who performed the autopsy said, the Greenville News reported. Police have turned their file on the case over to prosecutors, who are reviewing it, Greenville Police spokesman Johnathan Bragg said on Friday.","highlights":"Barbara Beam died in the home she shared with her sister and nephew in Greenville, South Carolina in January .\nA coroner ruled that she died from homicide by neglect and prosecutors are now deciding whether to charge her family members .\nHer sister told officers that she had not been moved from her bedroom chair for six months, and Beam had sores over her legs .\nWhen paramedics removed her from the chair and put her body on the ground, her legs stayed bent in a sitting position, police said .","id":"6c4a189f88973ac357f51498512f758c86105305"}

{"article":"Leeds striker Steve Morison admits he has never experienced anything like the current circus surrounding the SkyBet Championship side. Six players - Mirco Antenucci, Giuseppe Bellusci, Dario Del Fabro, Marco Silvestri, Souleymane Doukara and Edgar Cani - withdrew from the squad on the eve of Saturday's trip to Charlton citing injuries, and this is just the latest incident in another turbulent period at Elland Road. A 'freakish set of events' was how beleaguered boss Neil Redfearn described the sextet's absence after the game but Morison, who scored Leeds' goal in the 2-1 defeat at The Valley, told BBC West Yorkshire Sport: 'We're around it every day. Leeds United striker Steve Morison (centre) admits he is surprised by the chaos at Elland Road at the moment . Giuseppe Bellusci and three other Italians were among those who withdrew form the Leeds squad . Souleymane Doukara was another player that withdrew as part of the latest drama at Elland Road . 'People draw their own conclusions over what happened (with the withdrawals). It's a tough situation and you have to take everything at face value, but it's been like it all season in one way or another.' When asked if there was a split in the camp, the 31-year-old added: 'It's just been one of those seasons where every day something different has happened. 'I've never known anything like it in football and I've played for teams scrapping for their lives - Millwall last year - and teams that have been promoted. I've played in the Premier League with a bunch of Championship players that should never have stayed up and the one thing we had ultimately was a team and team spirit. 'Sometimes you can get away with being very, very average - I would class myself as an average footballer - but I've had a team around me and it works.' Former Leeds captain Trevor Cherry, meanwhile, branded the players who withdrew at short notice from Saturday's match a 'disgrace' and called for them to be sacked by the club. Italian quartet Antenucci, Bellusci, Del Fabro and Silvestri, Frenchman Doukara and Albanian Cani all told Redfearn they were injured and could not travel to London. According to the manager, Silvestri had been rested since sustaining a knock but had been expected to recover, while Antenucci and Cani declared themselves unfit after training on Thursday with the rest pulling out following a 'light' session on Friday. But Cherry was unimpressed and wants the players out of Elland Road. 'I would sack them and take the PFA (Professional Footballers' Association) on,' he said on BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek. 'I don't think players can do that, it's scandalous and it's just another story for Leeds United that is disgraceful.' Striker Antenucci used Twitter to defend himself, as did goalkeeper Silvestri who posted a picture of a cut on his back suffered against Norwich on Tuesday night. However, Cherry questioned if they were legitimate reasons to withdraw. 'In the old days you used to play with anything, cuts or one thing or another,' he said. 'The managers had a big say in whether you were fit or not. You didn't just come in and say 'I've got a headache, I'm going home'. I'm sure with George Graham or Don Revie, I can't imagine what would have happened if you'd have done that.' The withdrawals continued the chaos that has plagued Leeds. Mirco Antenucci was also among the six players to withdraw from the squad ahead of the defeat by Charlton . Neil Redfearn had a depleted squad to pick from when six players withdrew ahead of the Charlton game . Redfearn's position has become increasingly threatened over recent weeks, despite leading the club to Championship safety after taking over from ill-fated predecessors David Hockaday and Darko Milanic. He saw assistant Steve Thompson lose his job without warning on April 2 and his own deal, which expires at the end of the season, looks increasingly unlikely to be renewed under the club's current regime. Club president Massimo Cellino has been banned since January after being found guilty of not paying tax on a yacht in Italy, but is due to return in a fortnight's time. Cherry, who played for Leeds between 1972 and 1982, was left to lament the situation at his old club. 'It's a club that's a shambles and has been a shambles for 10 years,' the ex-England defender said. 'We just stutter from disaster to disaster, joke to joke. If it wasn't sickening it would be funny. You couldn't write a book about Leeds United and what's happened. 'Personally, I don't know the Italian guy but I don't think he realises the size of the club, it's just a little play thing and he's making a mess of it in my opinion.'","highlights":"Leeds forward Steve Morrison is surprised by the drama at the club .\nSix Leeds players recently withdrew from the squad to face Charlton .\nManager Neil Redfearn is facing increasing pressure in his role .","id":"60f3a215adf4fcbbb77029ac3f3ee6f930935be4"}

{"article":"Tom Hanks' wife Rita Wilson has revealed she was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and has undergone a double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery. The 58-year-old actress, who took a leave of absence from Broadway play 'Fish in the Dark' earlier this month, shared the news  through a statement published by\u00a0People\u00a0magazine on Tuesday. She explained that her first test for cancer came back negative but that she was correctly diagnosed after seeking a second opinion and underwent the procedure last week. 'Last week, with my husband by my side, and with the love and support of family and friends, I underwent a bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction for breast cancer after a diagnosis of invasive lobular carcinoma,' she said in the statement. Scroll down for video . By her side: Rita Wilson, who is married to Tom Hanks (pictured together in February), announced on Tuesday that she was recently diagnosed with cancer and has undergone a double\u00a0mastectomy . 'I am recovering and most importantly, expected to make a full recovery. Why? Because I caught this early, have excellent doctors and because I got a second opinion.' Before the diagnosis, Wilson said she had 'vigilantly monitored' her health with mammograms and MRIs because she knew she had an underlying condition of LCIS, (lobular carcinoma in situ)'. The mother-of-two explained that she recently underwent a breast biopsy, but no sign of cancer was discovered until she sought the opinion of a second doctor on the advice of a friend. The doctor discovered the cancer and she then sought out the opinion of another pathologist, who confirmed the diagnosis, she said. Rita, who married Oscar-winner Tom in 1988, went on to implore others to seek a second opinion before thanking her loved ones for their support. 'I share this to educate others that a second opinion is critical to your health,' she said. 'You have nothing to lose if both opinions match up for the good, and everything to gain if something that was missed is found, which does happen. Early diagnosis is key.' On Facebook on Tuesday, she encouraged other women to seek a 'necessary and vital' second opinion if they found themselves in similar situations. 'Not just by another doctor but by another pathologist,' she added. 'I'm doing well and getting stronger every day.' Advice: She shared the news on Facebook and linked to a statement printed by People magazine. Her cancer was not found in the first round of tests so she encourgaed others to seek a second opinion, like she did . Treatment: Wilson, pictured last year, said she underwent two  breast biopsies before she was diagnosed . Following her announcement, famous friends passed on their best wishes to the actress. 'Sending the wonderful Rita Wilson my love and best wishes for a speedy recovery and good health,' Katie Couric wrote on Twitter on Tuesday morning. Christiana Amanpour added: 'Wishing my good friend @RitaWilson the best as she makes this important announcement, which will help millions of women and their families.' 'Sending all my love to the brave and beautiful @RitaWilson,' Josh Groban tweeted. Wilson released the statement on Tuesday after it was announced earlier this month that she had temporarily left the Broadway play, written by and starring Larry David. At the time, a spokesperson said Wilson was expected to return to the stage on May 5. While on medical leave, she has been replaced by\u00a0Glenne Headly. Support: Celebrity friends flocked to Twitter to pass their best wishes to the actress after her announcement . Thankful: CNN host Christiane Amanpour noted how Wilson's statement will help future families . Admiration: Singer Josh Groban also sent his best wishes to the actress on Twitter on Tuesday . By her side: Actress Christina Applegate also sent her love to Wilson . Wilson is also known as the mother of Marnie, played by Allison Williams, in HBO's 'Girls'. She has two sons with Hanks, Chester Marlon, 24, and Truman Theodore, 19, as well as two stepchildren from Hanks' previous marriage - actor Colin Hanks, 37, and writer Elizabeth, 32 - to whom Wilson is close. Hanks and their mother, Samantha Lewes, had met in college but divorced in 1987, the year before he married Wilson. Lewes passed away in 2002, when she was just 49, after battling bone cancer. Wilson's message to other women to get screened comes just days after Taylor Swift revealed her mother, Andrea, had been diagnosed with cancer. She also urged her fans to remind their parents to get checked. Family: Wilson is pictured with Hanks and one of their sons, Chester, in December 2011. The couple has two sons together and Hanks is also father to a daughter and son from his first marriage . Invasive lobular carcinoma is a type of breast cancer that starts in the milk-producing glands of the breast and spreads in a web-like manner. Due to this, it does not typically form a lump, as is expected with breast cancer, and instead causes a thickening of the tissue, making one part of the breast feel fuller than other areas. Other symptoms including a change in the texture of appearance of the skin on the breast, such as dimpling, or an inverted nipple. Women with this type of breast cancer are usually a few years older than women diagnosed with other types, and it is more likely to occur in both breasts compared with other types. The cancer is invasive, which means it has the potential to spread to other parts of the body. It can be found through screening tests including physical exams or mammograms. Mammograms are encouraged yearly when a woman turns 40s or earlier if they have a family history of breast cancer. Treatment includes removing part or all of the breast followed by chemotherapy or radiation. According to the American Cancer Society, more than 180,000 women in the U.S. are diagnosed with invasive breast cancer each year, and about one in ten cases are invasive lobular carcinomas. The earlier the diagnosis, the better the prognosis. Patients have a slightly better outlook for both short- and long-term survival compared to other types of breast cancer. According to a study by Breast Cancer Research, the five-year survival rate is 85 per cent.","highlights":"The 58-year-old actress revealed her diagnosis in a statement on Tuesday .\nShe explained that doctors initially failed to find the cancer but that it was discovered after she sought out a second opinion .\nShe underwent surgery last week with Hanks by her side and she is expected to make a full recovery .\nWilson took medical from the Broadway play 'Fish in the Dark' earlier this month but is expected back on stage in May .","id":"49407463faf4dbabf23fe8a44a885b9d6c8f94f8"}
{"article":"Jeremy Clarkson will return to the BBC but not on Top Gear - even though bosses still haven't found his replacement. BBC2 boss Kim Shillinglaw, who has been tasked with finding a new presenter for the show, said Clarkson 'will be back' on the BBC, despite his very public sacking from Top Gear just last month. Speaking today about the show's future, the executive insisted there was 'no ban on Jeremy being on the BBC' and that the 54-year-old would return to the corporation once he had 'had some time'. Scroll down for video . BBC2 boss Kim Shillinglaw (left) who has been tasked with finding a new presenter for the show, said Clarkson (right) 'will be back' on the BBC, despite his very public sacking from Top Gear just last month . The final scenes filmed by the Top Gear team (pictured) before Jeremy Clarkson was unceremoniously sacked from the show will be aired this summer, according to the head of BBC2 . It comes as Ms Shillinglaw revealed that Clarkson's final moments on the motoring show would be aired this summer, saying that there was 'no way' she would let the material go to waste. She said: 'Jeremy will be back on the BBC. It's serious and unfortunate what happened but there is no ban on Jeremy being on the BBC. 'It's a a big deal what happened and Jeremy, as any human being would, needs some time.' Earlier this month, Clarkson pulled out of his planned appearance hosting BBC satirical show Have I Got News For You, which was due to be filmed this week, and aired a day later. It would have marked his first BBC appearance since the fracas which led to his departure. Referring to that decision, Ms Shillinglaw said: 'The BBC was prepared to have him on Have I Got News For You, it wasn't the BBC's decision not to go ahead with that particular show.' She confirmed that the scenes filmed before Clarkson's sacking were likely to air this summer, saying: 'No way would I want the available material not to be seen by viewers.' Kim Shillinglaw refused to say who would be replacing Clarkson. Asked if it would be a woman, she said female candidates were being considered . The channel boss also admitted that she had not yet found anyone to fill Clarkson's shoes on Top Gear. Amid growing pressure for a woman to be appointed as the lead host, she added that she not thinking of his replacement 'in terms of gender'. She said: 'I worked a lot with female presenters and when I used to work in science that was something across the piece that I really wanted to tackle, but I don't think I've ever approached an individual show thinking that was the way I want to cast it, so I think it's an open book on that. 'We'll definitely look at some women, but it's not a driving priority.' She added that the process of reinventing the show without its main star was 'creatively exciting'. Clarkson was suspended by the BBC last month during an internal investigation after he attacked Top Gear producer Mr Tymon, splitting his lip and verbally abusing him. Clarkson's contract was not renewed, with director-general Tony Hall saying 'a line has been crossed' and 'there cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another'. But the broadcasting veteran received widespread public support, including from friend David Cameron. Clarkson has said he is already thinking about his next television project. He wrote in his column for the Sunday Times: 'I have lost my baby but I shall create another. 'I don't know who the other parent will be or what the baby will look like, but I cannot sit around any more organising my photograph album.' Clarkson also revealed he was told he 'probably' had cancer two days before the 'fracas' with Mr Tymon, although he has since been given the all-clear. He said he considered turning his back on presenting altogether in the immediate fall-out from the incident. Jeremy Clarkson was suspended by the BBC last month after hitting a producer in a row at a hotel, before being told his contract would not be renewed by the corporation (pictured, in London earlier this month) He told the Sunday Times: 'Let's stop being silly and pick up the pieces and start again ... I just know I'm going to do another car show.' Earlier this month, North Yorkshire Police said Clarkson would face no further police action over his attack on the producer at a hotel. Clarkson first appeared on Top Gear in 1988, just after Noel Edmonds quit as lead host, rising through the ranks before leaving the show temporarily in 2001 during a ratings slump. When the show relaunched in 2002, Clarkson had rejoined the programme as head presenter, alongside Richard Hammond and Jason Dawe - who was replaced by James May in series two. The new studio-style format saw the show become the most watched programme on BBC2, and has been voted the best show on British television. Clarkson's brash presenting style, that often flirted with the boundaries of good taste, earned him legions of admirers and critics, and controversy was never far behind. He was censured by BBC bosses in 2014 after apparently using the n-word on television while reciting a nursery rhyme, and caused a stir a few months later after the Top Gear team were attacked while filming in Argentina. Locals had taken offence to a numberplate on Clarkson's car which read 'H982 FLK' - thought to be a reference to the Falklands war.","highlights":"BBC2's Kim Shillinglaw says Clarkson 'will be back' because there is 'no ban on Jeremy being on the BBC'\nShe insisted he would return in the future but currently 'needs some time'\nAlso said Top Gear scenes filmed before sacking would be aired in summer .\nMs Shillinglaw  said\u00a0females were being considered to take Clarkson's post .","id":"e5a68bd930e9bc728d0ac620d1b600e75845136e"}

{"article":"Tim Sherwood will consider selling Christian Benteke this summer if Aston Villa\u2019s star striker insists he wants to leave the club. Benteke has two years left on his contract once this season is completed and harbours ambitions to play in Europe. Sherwood said the Belgium international had given no suggestion he would like a transfer away and appeared to be enjoying his football at Villa Park. But the Villa manager admitted that, were the 24-year-old to demand a move, as he did two years ago, he would be inclined to sanction it. Villa are believed to value Benteke at upwards of \u00a325million and Wolfsburg have monitored his situation. Benteke has scored eight goals in his last six matches. Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke could be sold in the summer if he wants to go, says boss Tim Sherwood . The 24-year-old has two years left on his contract but harbours ambitions to play in Europe . Sherwood\u00a0said there would likely be talks over Benteke\u2019s \u00a350,000-a-week contract during the summer . \u2018We don\u2019t want to sell our best players,\u2019 said Sherwood. \u2018I also want players who want to play at the football club. \u2018He\u2019s made no indication to me that he wants to play elsewhere. If he does then we will assess the situation but we want to keep him at the club. \u2018You can\u2019t force any player, I\u2019ve been one myself. You might as well take the money because you end up without the money or the player if you don\u2019t take it.\u2019 Sherwood said there would likely be talks over Benteke\u2019s \u00a350,000-a-week contract during the summer. \u2018I know better how Tottenham went about their business regarding their contracts. I\u2019m not too sure how they go about it here,\u2019 said Sherwood. \u2018But it\u2019s certainly something that will have to be addressed. You don\u2019t really want players going into the last 18 months of their contract, he\u2019s someone for the long-term future and you need to protect your interests.\u2019 Sherwood accepts winning the FA Cup, meaning a place in the Europa League, could help. \u2018That would put everyone in a good mood, not only Christian,\u2019 he said. \u2018I think he is enjoying his time here and everyone is seeing that. He is a top player. We have a lot of top players in here and no-one wants to fight relegation. If we can get through this season we will build something where we are going to step upwards \u2014 we won\u2019t be in that position again.\u2019 Sherwood also wants to wipe any smile from Raheem Sterling\u2019s face by causing an FA Cup shock at Wembley on Sunday. Benteke (second left) scored the only goal of the game as Villa won 1-0 at Tottenham on April 11 . That goal at White Hart Lane was the Belgium international's eighth in his last six games for club and country . Footage this week emerged showing the Liverpool forward inhaling nitrous oxide, a legal high commonly known as laughing gas because it creates feelings of euphoria. Sherwood said: \u2018Let\u2019s hope he\u2019s not laughing after Sunday.\u2019 The Villa boss knows his ambitions to beat Liverpool and reach the FA Cup final may rest on taming Sterling, a player he tried to sign for Tottenham\u2019s academy as a schoolboy. The 20-year-old is enduring a tough time off the pitch, in a contract stand-off with Liverpool and coming under question for his recreational activities. Sherwood added: \u2018I have a wee bit of sympathy. I am not condoning it, but he is a young man, isn\u2019t he? He obviously has fortunes but is growing up like everyone else. It is tough in the public eye.\u2019 Raheem Sterling (right) was pictured smoking a shisha pipe with team-mate Jordon Ibe earlier this season . Another Liverpool player Sherwood discussed on Friday was Steven Gerrard, whose birthday falls on the FA Cup final on May 30. Those associated with the Merseyside club feel an ideal silverware send-off is brewing before Gerrard heads to LA Galaxy. \u2018Believe it or not it\u2019s not about spoiling the party for Steven Gerrard,\u2019 insisted Sherwood. \u2018It\u2019s about what we can do. To be honest we\u2019re hoping he\u2019s on his holiday in May.\u2019 Sherwood played against a teenage Gerrard in his latter days and hailed the 34-year-old\u2019s clear talent from the off. He added: \u2018I\u2019m sure Steven could still do a job for a Premier League side but I\u2019m not sure he can go and play for anyone other than Liverpool. He can earn \u00a31 a week or \u00a3200,000, he\u2019ll still play the same way.

{"article":"A young boy has been scarred for life after coming home Tuesday afternoon to find his parents dead - their bodies hacked with a chainsaw. Police in Lower Moreland, Pennsylvania received a call from the unidentified juvenile around 12:50pm and rushed to the home on the 100 block of Country Lane. While authorities have not yet officially identified the couple, family and friends say they were Chris and Nicole Peppelman, the owners of a local excavating company. Scroll down for video . Gruesome: Chris and Nicole Peppelman were found dead inside their Lower Moreland, Pennsylvania home Tuesday afternoon by one of their juvenile sons . Who's the killer? While both Mr and Mrs Peppelman had chainsaw cuts to their body, Montgomery County District Attorney says only Mrs Peppelman's death is being classified as a homicide currently. That suggests that the incident may have been a murder-suicide . The bodies of the 48-year-old husband and his 43-year-old wife were cut with what appears to be a chainsaw, but  so far only Mrs Peppelman's death has been classified as a homicide- suggesting that it may have been a murder-suicide. 'The death of the female seems to be an apparent homicide, however, the investigation is continuing. This is preliminary at this point,' Kevin Steele of the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office said. While friends and neighbors remembered the couple as outgoing and friendly, others admitted that the Peppelmans were going through a rough patch and that Mrs Peppelman had moved out of the house with their three sons. 'I know they've had some troubles, I've heard that from mutual friends and people that were closer to them recently than I have been, but they have been together I guess for 15-20 years,' Eric Shallcross, who went to high school with Mrs Peppelman, told WFMZ.

{"article":"The podium girl is the centre of a 'sexism storm' after Lewis Hamilton sprayed champagne in her face said she wasn't offended by his stunt - and was just doing her job. The British Formula 1 racer drew criticism from around the world when he aimed the fizz directly as the face of 23-year-old grid girl Liu Siying, who was pictured looking less than impressed. But the Shanghai Institute of Visual Art graduate, who was a 'podium girl' at the Chinese Grand Prix, said she didn't think much about the incident and wasn't annoyed. Scroll down for video . Liu Siying was pictured grimacing as Lewis Hamilton sprayed champagne at her face after winning the race . Sexism campaigners called Hamilton's behaviour 'selfish' but Siying said she did not think too much about it . The hostess said: 'I was told by my employer to stand on the podium, and that's what I did' 'It lasted for only one or two seconds, and I did not think too much about it at all,' Miss Siying told the Shanghai Daily. 'I think some foreign media are more sensitive about the topic compared to local media. 'I was just told by my employer to stand on the podium, and that\u2019s what I did.' Miss Siying had asked to work as a podium model on the stage of the Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai because she was a fan of Finnish driver Kimi Raikkonen. After the incident on Sunday, Object, a campaign group against sexism, condemned the behaviour of the driver as 'selfish and inconsiderate' and called on Hamilton to apologise to the graduate. Others have called the driving ace an 'embarrassment to the UK', while another said his actions showed that he was an 'ignorant clown'. Scroll down for video . It's not the first time racing ace Lewis Hamilton has sprayed a grid girl with bubbly - he's also done it after winning the Spanish Grand Prix and even at the Austrian Grand Prix, where he lost out on the top spot . After seeing the pictures the chief executive of campaign group Object asked for Hamilton to apologise . Speaking on Monday, Roz Hardie, chief executive of Object said Miss Siying would have had ittle choice but to 'stand there and take it'. She said: 'The photographs appear to show that the woman is not just being splashed, but that the champagne is being very specifically directed into her face, which does not look like a voluntary piece of horseplay on her part. 'If this if the case we think Lewis Hamilton should apologise for his actions and think carefully about how he behaves in the future.\u00a0For most people, it would be apparent that she is not enjoying it. 'It is surely a very difficult position to be a grid girl and she would have had little option but to stand there and take it. That is something of which he should be aware. But instead, he appears to have abused her position. 'It's unfortunate that a great victory has been marred by what appears to be selfish and inconsiderate behaviour.' Ms Hardie added that the episode highlighted the more general issue of women being viewed as sexual objects in the motoring world. Hamilton also sprayed a hostess at Montmelo after winning the Spanish Grand Prix\u00a0at Circuit de Catalunya . She said: 'Motor racing appears to unnecessarily portray women as sexualised objects and that probably makes it even harder for the women to stand up for themselves. We would hope people in the industry would be respectful to these women. On Twitter, Hamilton was described as a 'bully' and 'disgusting'.\u00a0Another user simply said: 'Man please stop spraying Champagne on the Podium Ladies. They don't like it', while one outraged user said he was a 'scumbag - an embarrassment to UK'. Another wrote: 'Have a bit more respect for the ladies please. Spraying Champagne in her face was out of order #child #idiot.' And one tweeted: 'Shame on you F1 and Lewis Hamilton for disgraceful treatment of women during champagne celebration#sexism.' It is not the first time the racing icon has whipped out his victory move. He celebrated in a similar fashion after winning Spanish Grand Prix last year, which was his fourth consecutive win in a row and\u00a0the one that finally put him on top of the World Championship table. And although he lost the Austrian Grand Prix to teammate Nico Rosberg, he didn't shy away from popping the cork directly at a hostess. The 30-year-old was even asked to demonstrate his champagne skills on Graham Norton's talk show in 2013. But not everyone was offended by his behaviour. Many found his actions amusing, while another said: 'I can think of worse things to happen at work than getting sprayed in the face with champagne by @LewisHamilton.. Lighten up people!' Hamilton controlled the contest in Shanghai to seal his second victory in three races and extend his lead at the summit of the Formula One world championship yesterday. But it wasn't all smiles at yesterday's race after a serious feud was sparked between Hamilton and his teammate Nico Rosberg, following a press conference. It wasn't all smiles after a serious feud was sparked between Hamilton and his teammate Nico Rosberg . The Mercedes driver poses with his trophy and champagne bottle on the podium after winning on Sunday . His Mercedes partner accused him of severely compromising his strategy and leaving him under unnecessary pressure from Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel. With the top three drivers covered by only 3.5 seconds ahead of the final round of pit-stops, Rosberg reported on the radio that \u2018Lewis is driving very slowly. Tell him to speed up.\u2019 Hamilton, seemingly protecting his tyres, was given the hurry-up by Mercedes and both he and Rosberg eventually emerged from their final pit-stop first and second with Vettel third. The world champion, sitting beside his teammate, told the press conference yesterday: 'I wasn't controlling his race, I was controlling my own race. 'My goal was to look after my car. I had no real threat from Nico throughout the whole race.' A visibly angry Rosberg replied: 'It's just now interesting to hear from you Lewis that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace in front when that was compromising my race. Nico Rosberg (left)\u00a0accused Hamilton of severely compromising his strategy and leaving him under pressure . 'Driving slower than was maybe necessary in the beginning of the stint meant Sebastian was close to me and it opened up the opportunity for Sebastian to try an early pit stop to try and jump me and then I had to cover him. 'It was unnecessarily close with Sebastian as a result, and also it cost me a lot of race time because I had to cover him. Then my tyres died at the end of the race because my stint was just so much longer, so I'm unhappy about that.' The spat has reopened the wounds from last year when both men tried to out-manoeuvre, and at times out-pysch one another as their battle for the title unfolded. It culminated in the pair colliding with one another in the Belgian Grand Prix, resulting in Rosberg being reprimanded and sanctioned by the team. This proved to be a turning point in the championship as Hamilton went on to dominate the closing races en route to taking his second crown.","highlights":"Lewis Hamilton showered her with champagne after winning Grand Prix .\nCampaigners against sexism said action was 'selfish and inconsiderate'\nBut Liu Siying says she wasn't offended and just doing her job .","id":"3acf7f52b9063647b6c938c800ad5e50b94cf30f"}
{"article":"Arrested: Rebecca Grant\u00a0tried to head-butt a deputy, scratched the police car's with her teeth, bit the upholstery and' threatened to kill the deputies' A Maine woman who was being hauled off to jail is facing even more charges after allegedly tearing apart a police cruiser with her teeth and attempting to head-butt a sheriff's deputy. Police in Limington, Maine, had been responding to reports that an apparently drunk woman was walking in and out of traffic and laying in the road on Saturday afternoon. Rebecca Grant, 40, initially claimed that she had been kidnapped and abused, but when she refused to give the name of her captors, police checked her ID and found that she was out on bail. Once York County sheriff\u2019s deputies learned she had bail conditions not to possess or consume alcohol they went to arrest her, Sheriff William King said. However, at this point, she became violent, and attempted to head-butt a deputy sheriff before 'thrusting her head onto the trunk of his cruiser on two occasions,' Bangor Daily News reports. Once Grant, from Biddeford, had been subdued and placed in the police car, officers found white residue on her teeth. They then discovered a three-inch scratch mark in the paint of the trunk, concluding that she had, in fact, 'bitten' the patrol cruiser. Enroute to York County Jail, Grant bit the upholstery, tearing the material, causing $500 worth of damage. She also attempted to kick out the car window, Sheriff King said. In addition, the 40-year-old allegedly threatened to kill deputies and their families. Grant was charged with violating her bail conditions and criminal mischief for causing $500 in damage to the cruiser. She remained jailed Tuesday on a $200 cash bail\u00a0at the York County Jail in Alfred. Ms Grant, 40, from Biddeford, was found walking 'drunk' in and out of traffic on a road in Limington, Maine .","highlights":"Police arrested Rebecca Grant, 40, for breaching bail conditions .\nFound apparently intoxicated walking into traffic in Limington, Maine .\nResisting arrest, she scratched car with her teeth and bit upholstery .\nShe also 'tried to head-butt a deputy and\u00a0threatened\u00a0to kill him'","id":"4254d6fa1098b6676e3be55d063caf7bf2eb3149"}
{"article":"Andy Hornby is non-executive chairman of Pharmacy 2U, which was found to be selling NHS patients' details on without their knowledge . The chairman of the online pharmacy site found to be selling NHS patients\u2019 data without their knowledge is the shamed former chief executive of HBOS. A Mail investigation yesterday told how the personal details of thousands of users of Pharmacy 2U are being sold to companies that target the sick. Now we can reveal that at its helm is the disgraced banker Andy Hornby, who was in charge of HBOS when it collapsed in 2008. Mr Hornby last night faced calls to step down from his role as non-executive chairman of Pharmacy 2U and was condemned for profiting from the sale of his customers\u2019 personal data. Many of those whose details he is selling on are some of the most vulnerable in society \u2013 either too ill to travel to their nearest surgery or the disabled. Others who use the NHS-approved pharmacy website used its online doctor consultations. Their details \u2013 which included email addresses and dates of birth \u2013 were passed on without proper consent. When Mr Hornby joined the company, the UK\u2019s leading online pharmacy, in 2012, it said in a statement: \u2018The imminent transition to electronic prescriptions across the NHS represents an exciting opportunity for Pharmacy 2U, and Andy\u2019s insights and leadership will be of significant value.\u2019 It is not known how much Mr Hornby \u2013 who works two to three days a week \u2013 is earning from the Leeds-based company, but it is thought he received a significant salary increase last year. He is also a principle shareholder. Dr Sarah Wollaston, the outgoing Tory chairman of the Commons health select committee, last night called for Mr Hornby to step down and for a criminal investigation into Pharmacy 2U. She said: \u2018He should be called to account for what his company is doing and issue a public statement. He needs to be made to sit down and explain why patient information is being sold on.\u2019 She added that the health select committee should launch an inquiry into the issue after the election. Pharmacy 2U, an online prescription service, sold details including\u00a0the patients\u2019 email addresses, dates of birth and date of their last prescriptions to marketing firms . Many of those whose details he is selling on are some of the most vulnerable in society \u2013 either too ill to travel to their nearest surgery or the disabled . Following the financial crash in the autumn of 2008, a devastating report by the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards accused Mr Hornby and fellow former bosses of \u2018catastrophic failures\u2019 as they presided over years of reckless lending. His current role is his third job since then. In 2011 he unexpectedly quit as \u00a31million-a-year chief executive of healthcare group Alliance Boots, a move blamed on stress. Dr Sarah Wollaston, the outgoing Tory chairman of the Commons health select committee, called for Mr Hornby to step down . Four months later he became boss of Coral, a position he still holds. In 2013, he faced calls to quit amid reports the bookmaker was set for a \u00a32billion flotation. Pharmacy 2U admitted that it had sold the names and addresses of \u2018up to 5,000\u2019 patients to data company Alchemy Direct but refused to say how much it had charged. It said it had decided to stop selling the information to Alchemy and stressed no medical data had been passed on. Last night Pharmacy 2U said that Mr Hornby is \u2018not involved in day-to-day decisions about the running of the business\u2019. A spokesman added: \u2018We have asked the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office to work with us to review our privacy policy and have also contacted the General Pharmaceutical Council, our industry regulator, and the NHS, to discuss this matter.\u2019 NHS England said: \u2018Any breach of confidentiality is totally unacceptable.

{"article":"A young Australian rugby player has died following a freak accident during a match in which he hit his head against an opponent's shoulder. Nicholas Tooth, 25, was playing for the Quirindi Lions against the Narrabri Blue Boars in mid-north NSW on Saturday when he collapsed after hitting his head on an opponent's shoulder during a tackle. He was treated at the ground before being airlifted to Newcastle's John Hunter Hospital in a critical condition but died in hospital late on Sunday. Scroll down for video . Nicholas Tooth, 25, died after sustaining a head injury when he hit his head on an opponent's shoulder in a tackle during a first grade rugby union match on Saturday . The young man was visiting his hometown in the New England region of NSW for the weekend . 'Nick went in to tackle an opponent and his head clashed with the shoulder and he went down,' Quirindi Lions club president Charles Murray told the\u00a0ABC. 'There was no foul play, nothing untoward about it at all. Sadly it was just a very tragic accident.' Originally from Wallabadah in the New England region of NSW, Mr Tooth, who had been working in the agricultural grain industry, was visiting his home town for the weekend. The young man had been living in Sydney while studying at Sydney University, and tributes have since poured in for the 25-year-old. Australian Rugby Union chief executive Bill Pulver told Daily Mail Australia\u00a0in a statement that the loss of Mr Tooth was 'incredibly sad'.

{"article":"Washington (CNN)Decision time for GOP operatives, another controversial foreign policy choice for President Obama, a ripple effect from the Robert Menendez indictment, and two insights into Hillary Clinton's campaign launch -- those stories filled our Sunday trip around the \"Inside Politics\" table. Obama's Iran diplomacy already has his conservative critics fired up, and things could get even more interesting in the week ahead. The President is headed to Panama for a regional summit, and Julie Pace of The Associated Press reports one of the big questions is whether he'll make history and have a face-to-face meeting with Cuban leader Raul Castro. \"This would be the first meeting between a U.S. and a Cuban leader in decades,\" said Pace. \"But Obama's efforts to end this freeze of Cuba have been a lot more difficult than they looked when he announced it last year,\" Pace said.  \"And so what the White House is going to be weighing is whether this meeting would be a way to generate more progress or whether it would be a premature reward for the Castros.\" Hillary Clinton has leased her headquarters space in Brooklyn and will soon make her presidential campaign official. And with the launch, Jonathan Martin of The New York Times reports, will come a carefully orchestrated effort to reintroduce Clinton -- with an emphasis on her childhood and her earlier work on children's issues. \"The Democrats around Hillary Clinton believe that while she's one of the most famous people in the world, she's never been properly introduced in her own right,\" said Martin. \"So when she does roll out her campaign here in a couple of weeks, look for more biographical touches. We'll hear about her childhood in suburban Chicago and some of the work that she did as an advocate for the Legal Services Corporation and the Children's Defense Fund when she was in her 30s, and also, more about her Arkansas days as first lady, as an advocate for education.\" A lot of the big names signing on to Team Clinton are already known. But Dan Balz of The Washington Post explains part of the statement her campaign wants to make with the announcement is to show it has a large, experienced staff ready for the key national and state roles. \"What I'm hearing is that when they launch, this staff is going to be even much, much bigger than we, at this point, imagine, that they have done a huge amount of hiring,\" said Balz. And Balz reports the planning centers on smaller events designed to highlight more personal interaction. \"She did an event with the wife of the mayor of New York earlier this week that could be a template for the kinds of things they're doing.\" Much of the media attention on the corruption indictment against Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey has been on its allegations of luxury hotel stays with girlfriends. But beyond the more tabloidesque details, Jackie Kucinich of The Daily Beast notes that one of the charges centers on a suggestion the senator's staff was soliciting funds for a so-called super PAC -- a violation of campaign finance laws. And she says the scrutiny of that practice might grow because of the Menendez allegations. \"I was talking to some campaign finance watchdogs this week and they say if the (Federal Election Commission) really starts to look into this, they're actually going to find some impropriety with other lawmakers much much farther than Menendez,\" said Kucinich. \"So watch for that if it starts happening.\" By a week from Monday, there will be three official GOP candidates for president: Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Marco Rubio. Others will soon follow, and as things get more official, pressure is mounting on GOP operatives to choose sides. In New Hampshire this past week, Matt Maroney, a former Mitt Romney alum with ground organizing experience, signed on with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's team. Others in the state reported calls coming in from Ohio Gov. John Kasich and, yes, even Donald Trump. This dynamic plays out on the national level, too: Republican pollster Tony Fabrizio, for example, was approached both by Team Christie and by allies of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. In the end, though, Fabrizio signed on with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who makes his official announcement on Tuesday.","highlights":"White House weighing whether Obama should meet with Raul Castro .\nA serious congressional ripple effect from the Menendez indictment?\nIt's decision time for GOP operatives as the 2016ers get ready to launch .","id":"5c3e16c415b463269527cafd220170e1303048f8"}
{"article":"(CNN)The leader of Yemen's Houthi rebels vowed not to back down on Sunday as a top Saudi military official claimed weeks of airstrikes had significantly weakened the Shiite group. \"Our fighters will not evacuate from the main cities or the government institutions,\" rebel leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi said in a televised address. \"Anyone who thinks we will surrender is dreaming.\" His comments came after more than three weeks of Saudi-led coalition bombings aimed at pushing back the Houthis, who surged into the capital of Sanaa in January and ousted President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi from power. Hadi still claims he's Yemen's legitimate leader and is working with the Saudis and other allies to return to his country. Since mid-March, more than 700 people have been killed in violence that shows no sign of slowing, according to figures from the World Health Organization. The Houthis say they have the support of the country's people behind them. \"It's the right of the Yemeni people to stand against the attacks in all possible means as long as the attacks continue,\" Al-Houthi said Sunday. \"After our people move and react against the attacks and killing of children and women, we do not want to hear any voices and cries.\" But there are signs of some fracturing among forces loyal to former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, many of whom have fought alongside the rebels. Gen. AbdulRahman AlHalili, who leads more than 10,000 troops, has now allied himself with Hadi, military sources said Sunday. Meanwhile, Saudi Brig. Gen. Ahmed Asiri said Sunday that airstrikes had decimated the Houthis' central command by targeting their communications. The rebels, he said, are now holding a defensive stance in besieged areas. Since it began the campaign known as Operation Decisive Storm on March 26, the Saudi-led coalition has launched 2,300 airstrikes, Asiri said.

{"article":"These incredible photos are about as close to an adult version of Where's Wally as you can get. Blended into the background, these models are difficult to tell apart from their surroundings. Camouflaged in body paint, women pose for the camera against a backdrop of overgrown woodland. A series of pictures by German artist J\u00f6rg D\u00fcsterwald show body-painted models camouflaged in woodland .

{"article":"Tom Boyd believes Jason Denayer\u2019s loan spell at Celtic has been so successful that he is now ready to challenge for a place at Manchester City next season. Such an outcome would obviously deny Ronny Deila\u2019s stated aim of retaining the young Belgian for another year, yet Boyd also sees a clear positive. To the former Celtic captain, Denayer\u2019s development can act as a perfect advert to encourage more emerging talents to take their next career step at Parkhead. Young defender Jason Denayer (left) has impressed on loan at Celtic this season . The 19-year-old recently won his first international cap for Belgium in a Euro 2016 qualifier against Cyprus . The 19-year-old earned a first full cap for his country when he came off the bench in their 1-0 win in Israel on Tuesday night following a red card for Vincent Kompany. Denayer will hope to join Kompany in City\u2019s first-team squad when he returns to his parent club this summer and Boyd feels he is equipped to take that step. \u2018Jason certainly looks like he could go back to Man City and make an impression,\u2019 said Boyd. \u2018For a young boy, he\u2019s been exceptional. He looks a lot older in his play and it surprises you when you remind yourself how young he actually is. \u2018The only question is whether he will get the opportunities he wants down there. I think he will, especially now that he is featuring for Belgium in a qualification game. \u2018Unfortunately, Celtic can\u2019t compete with the money on offer in England. The new television deal down there has taken things to another level again. \u2018I\u2019d love Jason to stay at Celtic for 10 years but that\u2019s not going to happen. He\u2019s an ambitious boy and wants to go and challenge himself to be the best he can. From some of the games I\u2019ve seen, I think he could slot into that City defence no problem. Denayer has been tipped to partner Belgium team-mate Vincent Kompany (left) on his return to City . Denayer has formed a successful partnership with Dutchman Virgil van Dijk (left) at Parkhead . \u2018However, hopefully his success will help Celtic bring more youngsters in. Previously people said you move to England to get international caps. Jason and Fraser Forster showed that\u2019s not the case. \u2018Hopefully Celtic can say, \u201cCome here and you will progress\u201d and use those examples to attract players.\u2019 Sportsmail revealed earlier this week that Hearts captain Danny Wilson is one central defensive candidate under consideration by Celtic as they look a potential additions for next term. \u2018Good players attract attention and Danny has been playing very well for Hearts,\u2019 said Boyd. \u2018He is certainly someone who was very promising as a young boy and is hopefully getting back to that level.\u2019 The current partnership between Denayer and Virgil van Dijk has formed the foundation of Celtic\u2019s bid for the Treble \u2013 a feat the club last achieved in 2001 when Boyd was skipper. Manager Ronny Deila should be able to attract rising youngsters to the Hoops, claims Tom Boyd . Celtic are considering a bid for Hearts defender Danny Wilson to shore up their defence . While some will point to the absence of a competitive Rangers from the top-flight, the ex-Scotland international is adamant a domestic clean sweep this term would be the equal of his achievement under Martin O\u2019Neill\u2019s management. \u2018A Treble this year would stand beside the other three in Celtic\u2019s history,\u2019 said Boyd. \u2018You have to beat what is in front of you. \u2018There have only been three in Celtic\u2019s history and that tells you how hard it is to achieve it. \u2018If they do get the Treble, there should be the same adulation as when my team won it in 2001 and Jock Stein\u2019s team did it twice. \u2018It would be a fantastic achievement if Scott Brown was collecting the Scottish Cup to complete a Treble. \u2018The League has been a challenge with Aberdeen doing so well, although I think the pressure will eventually tell. \u2018You can\u2019t take away what Celtic have achieved so far and sometimes the difficult part of the Treble is winning the cups. \u2018Celtic have had a terrible record in the League Cup over the years and that shows how hard it is. \u2018I\u2019d like to see the talking done when they have two in the bag and are preparing for the Scottish Cup final. \u2018Ronny\u2019s approach is new. He\u2019s spoken about the Treble from the start but it does show the level of confidence he has.\u2019 Former captain Boyd insists a treble for Celtic this season will equal his own three-way success from 2001 . Boyd was speaking at Hampden as he launched the search for nominees to be inducted into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame. The 49-year-old has a very decent claim himself, but would be delighted if figures who operated behind the scenes were recognised. \u2018Professor (Stewart) Hillis, who passed away last year, and other Scotland backroom guys who maybe aren\u2019t as well-known would be very deserving of being in there. \u2018Jimmy Steele is another one who contributed a lot with Celtic and the national team - and I think that would be a great gesture if they were inducted.\u2019 Fans can make nominations by logging on to sfmhalloffame.co.uk. Inductees will be announced at a Hampden dinner on October 18.","highlights":"Young Belgian Jason Denayer has impressed on loan with Celtic .\nFormer Hoops captain Tom Boyd claims the defender is ready to challenge for a place at Manchester City next season .\nRonny Deila is looking at Hearts defender Danny Wilson to fill the void .","id":"14c87a52d91540ff03fbc860d729353930209535"}
{"article":"Forget helicopters and BMWs, could the ultimate symbol of wealth be clothes made from gold? On a catwalk show which took place in Xi'an, the capital city of north-western China's Shaanxi province, models strutted their stuff in items made from the precious metal. Including underwear and a chain-mail style shirt which it has been revealed would be worth around \u00a340,000. And this was no lightweight affair either. On a catwalk in Xi'an in China models strutted their stuff in gold underwear, it is thought the look is influenced by royal women in history . The shirt alone worn by the male model weighed in at 7lbs and the matching bra and underwear for the female model also came in at 7lbs. The idea for real gold clothing takes its inspiration from royal women in history, including Cleopatra, Marie Antoinette and Tsarina Alexandra who all reportedly had gold clothing. The organisers of the event said that it took 30 craftsmen three months to make the gold shirt and the women's clothing which is also worth around \u00a340,000. Fashion photographer Manchu Peng, 30, who attended event said: 'There were some good designs there but the gold clothing items really stole the show.' It took 30 craftsmen three month to make this shirt which is mean out of real gold and has a chain-mail style . The model showed off his shirt as on-lookers checked out how the design was made . The idea came after a Chinese designer unveiled an extraordinary set of underwear made entirely of gold last year. The items however were produced as a work of art and not intended for sale. They were modelled by an unnamed woman who was joined by two other models - both of whom posed with glittering gold accessories, including necklaces, a shoe and a rabbit at a store in China. These two women proudly showed off their gold underwear, the items are not for sale but are said to be worth around \u00a340,000 . This gold underwear set has an intricate design with the model wearing a pair of white pants underneath it to protect her modesty . And prior to that a Turkish jeweller unveiled a series glamorous gold dresses - each worth a staggering \u00a385,000. Artisan Ahmet Atakan, based in Izmir, a city in Turkey, crafted each frock out of a total of 78,000 pieces of the expensive metal to form a mesh-like fabric. Despite the eye-watering price tag of 300 thousand Turkish Liras (about \u00a384,800), eight of the unique gowns have already been sold.","highlights":"Designs made from real gold were shown on the catwalk in Xi'an China .\nModels strutted their stuff in underwear and a shirt made from gold .\nThe items cost around \u00a340,000 each but are not intended for sale .","id":"9a50a48123256a3624c0b22de62319a8e1f12b75"}

While the first ever picture of James featured the newborn in an adorable fox outfit. Sarah commented on the photo: 'James Hunter (4\/14\/15) 8.7lbs\/22 inches of HEALTHY baby! 'Thank you for the positive support throughout my journey... It's just beginning!!! #JamesHunter #Healthy' During her pregnancy many people commented that they felt Sarah's unusually trim figure could be damaging to her unborn child, but it seems their fears were unfounded. Sarah posted this adorable picture of James to her Instagram commenting that it was 'love at first sight' Sarah confirmed her happy news to E!\u00a0revealing that her baby boy was  22 inches long at the time of his birth, adding: 'He's a big healthy boy and he got an APGAR score of eight to nine.' An APGAR score, which stands for Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration, is a quick method for assessing the health of a newborn, with scores of seven or above being considered normal. Sarah famously documented her changing figure via her Instagram\u00a0page throughout her pregnancy, earning herself a huge number of fans - as well as a fair share of critics - in the process. Although the now mother came under fire last month as more and more critics spoke out against toned figure their comments never stopped the model from sharing numerous photos of her tight abs with her 1.6 million Instagram followers. In this gorgeous snap James is seen sleeping in a giraffe costume . On Tuesday Sarah shared a photo of two In-N-Out burgers, writing, 'Cravings,' although its not clear as to whether or not she enjoyed the meal before or after she gave birth. The lingerie-clad model snapped her last pregnancy selfie on Monday, which she captioned: 'Still waiting #9months [sic].' The snapshot of her in a black bra and thong\u00a0underwear has been liked over40,000 times since it was posted, and has earned nearly 4,000 comments. And Sarah, who is of European and Costa Rican descent, took to Instagram last week to share a photo of growing belly during the last weeks of her of pregnancy, writing: '10 days until we meet #BabyJames.' But Sarah didn't just receive harsh comments. Many women noted that they found Sarah's pregnancy body to be motivation to work out and live a healthy lifestyle. Sarah struck various poses for these selfies of herself in her underwear which she posted throughout her pregnancy . Haters gonna hate: Sarah, who came under fire for her being tiny and toned throughout her pregnancy, told her critics to unfollow her if they have a problem with her pictures . Pregnant model Sarah Stage snapped this photo of herself flaunting her barely-there baby bump 10 days before she was supposed to give birth to her son . 'I'm completely inspired to go to the gym first thing in the morning. You look absolutely gorgeous @sarahstage #amazing [sic],' one fan wrote. 'You look absolutely lovely. Hats off to you for being fit and taking care of yourself!' another added. 'If I ever have children, I'm inspired by you to treat my pregnancy the very same way. I'm sure James will be amazing! Congratulations.' Others compared their figures to Sarah's pregnancy body, with one woman writing: '10 days before giving birth?! Lord Jesus help us all! I look like this after dinner [sic].' 'I look like that after a good meal or two,' someone else commented. Meanwhile, some people suggested that her son would be as tiny as she is - although it has since been proved that their fears about the young boy's size were unfounded. Sarah and her friend compared their growing bellies for this playful picture . Sarah shared this adorable photo of matching father and son Timberland boots . 'Baby James will come out the size of her phone case,' one person commented, referencing the model's bear-shaped cell phone cover.

And despite her critics, Sarah refused to hide her then-eight-month pregnant body in maternity clothes. Sarah refused to wear baggy clothes during her pregnancy and instead opts for figure-hugging dresses like the one she is wearing in this picture . Sarah wore this sexy black dress on a 'date night' when she was 37 weeks pregnant, two weeks before James was born . She shunned baggy dresses and instead dressed her bump in fitted Lycra or nothing at all. The fitness fanatic loves hitting the gym and captures herself working out, as well as following a healthy diet of quinoa,spinach and chicken. Clearly not letting her growing baby bump get in the way of her career, Sarah continued to proudly model whilst carrying. Two weeks ago, she shared a sexy snapshot of herself in black underwear and responded to her haters. 'BTW If you don't like my pics then unfollow me,' she wrote. 'I'm excited, happy and enjoying every second of my pregnancy. Can't wait to meet James! #NFG #37weeks [sic].'","highlights":"Sarah Stage, 30, welcomed James Hunter into the world on Tuesday .\nThe baby boy weighed eight pounds seven ounces and was 22 inches long .\nDuring her pregnancy Sarah was criticised for her trim figure and abs .","id":"002e6d0357c253728d1351b572369225aec21fe8"}

{"article":"Builders in Turkey have accidentally found one of the largest and most complex underground cities in the otherworldly region of Cappadocia. The area is famous for its stunning rock formations, deep valleys and ancient subterranean hideouts, which have been carved from volcanic ash rock. The latest find is thought to be the biggest underground city in Cappadocia, consisting of 3.5 miles (7km) of tunnels, secret churches, tombs and safe havens. Scroll down for video . Builders in Turkey have accidentally found one of the largest and most complex underground cities in the otherworldly region of Cappadocia. \u00a0The city lies beneath the Nev\u015fehir fortress (pictured). Three entrances to the impressive complex can be seen, leading to vast, winding tunnels . The subterranean city dates back around 5,000 years and was discovered when builders saw signs of a massive network of tunnels while moving mounds of Earth. It lies beneath the Nev\u015fehir fortress and the surrounding area, which was being excavated during a construction project carried out by Turkey's Housing Development Administration (TOK\u0130). The multilevel settlement is likely to include living spaces, kitchens, wineries, chapels, staircases, according to a report in National Geographic. The find is similar to the discovery of another underground city, Derinkuyu, which was made in 1963 when a man took down the wall in his basement.

The latest find is thought to be the biggest underground city in Cappadocia, consisting of 3.5 miles (7km) of tunnels, secret churches, tombs and safe havens. Scientists have yet to discover all its secret passages . Cappadocia, or 'Kapadokya' in Turkish, translates as 'land of the beautiful horses' and tourists often catch a glimpse of long-maned horses galloping through the formations. Millions of years ago, volcanic activity covered the region under several layers of ash. Erosion then created a landscape of rock formations and spires known as 'fairy chimneys.' The volcanic rock, or 'tuff,' was soft and highly malleable, and proved ideal building material. The idea for underground cities came during the Byzantine-era when residents used them as hideouts when threatened by invasion by the Persians, Arabs and Seljuq Turks. The latest find is similar to the discovery of another underground city, Derinkuyu, which was made in 1963 when a man took down the wall in his basement. Derinkuyu was once home to 20,000 residents living together underground, in a city eleven levels deep with 600 entrances. Derinkuyu was once home to 20,000 residents living together underground, in a city eleven levels deep with 600 entrances. It had areas for sleeping, stables, wells, kitchens, ventilation shafts, tombs, communal rooms, bathrooms. Like Derinkuyu, the latest underground city was built to protect residents from invaders, but remains largely unexplored. But this city is far larger, with early estimates suggesting it could be around a third bigger than Derinkuyu. Geophysicists from Nev\u015fehir University recently conducted a systematic study of a 1.5 mile (4 km) area using geophysical resistivity and seismic tomography. The studies suggest the underground corridors may go as deep as 371ft (113 metres), but the exact size remains unknown.

Pictured is an entrance to the city . The volcanic rock, or 'tuff,' was soft and highly malleable, and proved ideal building material. The idea for underground cities came during the Byzantine-era when residents used them as hideouts when threatened by invasion by the Persians, Arabs and Seljuq Turks. 'This new discovery will be added as a new pearl, a new diamond, a new gold' to Cappadocia's riches, Hasan \u00dcnver, mayor of Nev\u015fehir, told National Geographic. He says he wants to build 'the world's largest antique park,' with boutique hotels and art galleries aboveground, and walking trails and a museum below. 'We even plan to reopen the underground churches,' he says. 'All of this makes us very excited.'

Pictured on the left is one of its corridors and on the right the excavation site . Like Derinkuyu, the latest underground city was built to protect residents from invaders, but remains largely unexplored. But this city is far larger, with early estimates suggesting it could be around a third bigger than Derinkuyu .

{"article":"Havana, Cuba (CNN)All eyes are going to be on the new kid finally allowed to play and the big kid who for so long wanted nothing to do with him -- Cuba and the United States in the same diplomatic playground. Cuba pulled off a diplomatic coup by marshaling the support of other regional countries to insist on their attendance at the Summit of the Americas. And for the first time since 1962, the U.S. has not blocked Cuba's attempt to join. Now it's time to see how they play and who they play with -- especially Venezuela, which often falls out with Washington for crushing dissent at home and supplying Havana with billions of dollars in oil. Cuba is trying to re-establish itself at the two-day summit in Panama, arriving with more than 100 government officials, diplomats, small business people and artists. But Cuba's attempts to rebrand itself as an open, diverse society stumbled Wednesday when government supporters and anti-Castro supporters brawled in the streets of Panama. Video of the incident showed Cuban government officials exchanging punches and insults with dissidents until Panamanian police in riot gear broke up the melee. With the historic thawing in relations between the U.S. and Cuba, Washington now has urgent business to discuss with Havana. \"We have really big issues with the Cubans that do need to be solved,\" said Ambassador Vicki Huddleston, who served as the chief of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. She added \"The Cubans are typical of their negotiating style. You think it's going to be easy because we have said 'We are going to have good relations with you' and they say, 'That's not exciting for us and it is for you.' So they are hard negotiators as they always have been.\" The forum could provide the opportunity to push forward an agreement to re-establish formal relations and re-open embassies after nearly four months of negotiations. While President Barack Obama is not scheduled to meet Cuban leader Raul Castro, U.S. officials said there will be opportunities for \"interaction\" between the two leaders. The first time the two heads of state met was in 2013 at Nelson Mandela's funeral. Their brief handshake captured the world's attention and lit up social media. Few people then knew that the two countries were secretly involved in negotiations to thaw five decades of deadlocked Cold War-era relations. Obama had said he had hoped a U.S. Embassy would reopen in Havana before the summit, but Cuban officials have said they cannot imagine a full restoration of diplomatic ties until Cuba is removed from the U.S. State Department list of countries that support terrorism. \"It would be difficult to explain that diplomatic relations have been resumed while Cuba has been unjustly listed as a state sponsor of international terrorism,\" said Josefina Vidal, the general director of U.S. affairs at the Cuban Foreign Ministry and lead negotiator in the talks. Cuba was added to the list in 1982, which includes Syria, Iran and Sudan. The designation carries financial sanctions which Cuban officials say further damages their already ailing economy. The State Department has sent a recommendation to the White House that Cuba be removed, paving the way for the White House to announce its intent to de-list Cuba as early as this week, two administration officials told CNN. Removal from the list \"does not relate to whether or not we agree with everything a country does or whether we agree with its political system, or its foreign policy,\" Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said on a conference call with reporters Tuesday. \"It's a very practical review as to whether or not a government is sponsoring terrorism.\" Rhodes also dialed backed rhetoric on Venezuela, saying the country did not pose a national security threat to the United States, despite a recent declaration to that effect. The designation was meant to allow officials to target seven allegedly corrupt Venezuelan officials, but it ignited a firestorm, particularly in Cuba, which has close ties to Venezuela. Deceased Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez was a friend and admirer of former Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Chavez's successor Nicolas Maduro continues to send Cuba tens of thousands of barrels of oil each day, despite his country's own economic turmoil. In exchange, Cuba sends doctors, military advisers and sports trainers to Venezuela. In Cuba's state-run media, criticism of U.S. policy towards Venezuela has overshadowed the improvement in U.S.-Cuba relations. In March, Fidel Castro published a letter criticizing the U.S.' \"brutal plans towards\" Venezuela and the Cuban government promised \"unconditional aid\" to help defend against American threats. Its remains to be seen how much Cuba will risk its warming relations with the United States to back up ally Venezuela. But apparently there is little doubt among the Cuban people on what their government should do. A poll of 1,200 Cubans released on Wednesday found that 97% of the people surveyed by Miami-based polling firm Bendixen & Amandi on behalf of The Washington Post and Univision Noticias\/Fusion supported improved U.S.-Cuban relations.","highlights":"Cuba pulled off a diplomatic coup by gaining attendance at Summit of the Americas .\nFirst time since 1962, the U.S. has not blocked Cuba's attempt to join .\nCuba is trying to re-establish itself at the two-day summit in Panama .","id":"3fbdee096ce9d027da681c5f9c89eb319ff21a9f"}

{"article":"Everton midfielder James McCarthy believes Ross Barkley is more than capable of handling the highs and lows which accompany the tremendous expectation which rests on his shoulders. The 1-0 victory over Southampton, courtesy of captain Phil Jagielka's fifth goal of the season, was a case in point. In the first half he produced a brilliant piece of control and skill to skip past three opponents and launch an attack from deep inside his own half which brought Goodison Park to its feet. Everton midfielder James McCarthy believes Ross Barkley is capable of handling the pressure on him . McCarthy (left) said he thought Barkley was 'different class' despite a mistake with an ambitious pass . However, when his ambitious pass after the break gifted possession to the visitors the all-too familiar sound of loud groans echoed around the ground. Then, to cap it all, manager Roberto Martinez's decision to replace him with 20 minutes to go - a requirement to help shore up a tight game - was greeted with disagreement and boos. It is difficult to know what Barkley, who was lauded for two substitute appearances for England in the last 10 days, thought of it, but McCarthy is confident the youngster can deal with the complexities and confusion which appear to surround most of his performances. 'I think Ross was different class,' he said. 'I thought he worked really hard for the team and was a real nuisance driving at people and it was brilliant to see him high in confidence having been away with England. Barkley was withdrawn with 20 minutes to go at Goodison Park, a decision that brought boos from the crowd . 'Ross is a good lad and has his feet firmly on the ground and has a lot of people at the club looking after him. 'He won't get carried away. We have a lot of characters, a lot of experienced heads in the dressing room and there is no better place to be for him.' Aside from Jagielka's 16th-minute goal, giving the centre-back his best tally in eight years at the club, the only other notable action saw goalkeeper Tim Howard claw away Graziano Pelle's early shot from under his crossbar and throw out a hand, while diving the wrong way, to stop James Ward-Prowse's strike. Everton achieved what they were unable to do earlier in the season and ground out victory to make it three successive wins, moving them to 11th in the table, with the relegation fears of a couple of weeks ago now a thing of the past. With nothing to play for in their remaining seven matches McCarthy believes the motivation is to remain unbeaten until the end of the campaign. McCarthy is confident youngster Barkley can deal with the complexities of his sometimes indifferent form . 'We want to kick on, go on a winning run and finish the season strongly,' he added. 'We have won three games and we want to go unbeaten until the end of the season, although that is easier said than done. 'There has been a big improvement. So far, so good, but we won't get carried away. 'The most important thing was to get three points and dig in deep to secure it with a clean sheet.' With leading scorer Romelu Lukaku not quite ready to return after a hamstring injury, the onus was on other players to step up, but few would have bet on Jagielka being the match winner against Saints. Everton secured a 1-0 victory over Southampton, courtesy of captain Phil Jagielka's fifth goal of the season . 'He is different class. He is brilliant to have at the club and is a true leader on the pitch,' said McCarthy. 'A lot of people have been saying the last few weeks he has been exceptional, but for me he has been outstanding throughout the campaign and he is chipping in with goals.' Southampton boss Ronald Koeman conceded his side's Champions League hopes were now over, but was still keen to secure European football next season. Southampton boss Ronald Koeman conceded his side's Champions League hopes were now over . 'European football for the club will be a great success if we reach it,' he said. 'If we showed the ambition we showed (against Everton) then we will have a good chance.'

'Pelle is struggling but that is football, it is normal. If I don't have confidence I don't pick him in the line-up,' he added.","highlights":"Everton beat Southamton 1-0 at Goodison Park on Saturday afternoon .\nRoss Barkley showed his skill but made an error that saw the crowd groan .\nTeam-mate James McCarthy is confident he can deal with the pressure .","id":"bddbd13ee67ecd42a8ea7f5de79de092b22df526"}
{"article":"Discount store Aldi\u2019s astonishing success story continued yesterday as it overtook upmarket rival Waitrose to become the sixth biggest supermarket in Britain. The German discounter has won an increasing share of the market since the recession as cash-strapped families look for cheaper alternatives. It now lags behind only the \u2018big four\u2019 \u2013 Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s, Morrisons \u2013 and the Co-operative. Growth: Discount chain Aldi now has a bigger market share than upmarket supermarket Waitrose . Major supermarkets have slashed prices in recent months to fend off competition from cut-price rivals such as Aldi and Lidl. Despite this Aldi has lifted its market share from 4.6 per cent to 5.3 per cent in the past three months. Waitrose has 5.1 per cent of the market, up from 5 per cent, according to consumer research firm Kantar Worldpanel. Lidl claimed recently that Britain\u2019s middle classes had become the \u2018Lidl Classes\u2019 after sales rose by a fifth in a year. But while Lidl remains eighth behind Waitrose, Aldi is now one of Britain\u2019s mainstream supermarkets. Between January and the end of March, Aldi sales grew by 17 per cent from the same time a year earlier. This compares to 3 per cent growth for Waitrose, lifting its share of the market. The total market share of the \u2018big four\u2019 fell below 73 per cent, the lowest for a decade. Aldi \u2013 motto Spend a little. Live a lot \u2013 stocks virtually all own-branded goods and offers a far smaller selection of goods. By contrast middle-class rival Waitrose, part of the John Lewis Partnership, focuses on customer service and high-quality produce. Increase: Consumer research firm Kantar Worldpanel said Aldi sales grew by 17 per cent from January and the end of March compared to the same time a year earlier, compared to 3 per cent growth for Waitrose . Aldi has 560 stores and hopes to double in size by 2022. Yesterday, it announced it was opening nine more stores in London, creating up to 600 jobs. Kantar Worldpanel said Aldi had recorded double-digit growth for the past four years. More than half a million new shoppers visited the store in the three months to March 29, compared to a year before. Lidl saw sales jump by almost 12 per cent over the period to secure a 3.7 per cent market share. This is some way off Tesco\u2019s dominant 28.4 per cent share, followed by Asda at 17.1 per cent. But Fraser McKevitt, at Kantar Worldpanel, said the success of Aldi and Lidl meant the entire structure of the \u2018supermarket landscape\u2019 was changing. The price war between upmarket retailers and discounters has led to significantly cheaper food. The Office for National Statistics says food prices fell by more than 3 per cent in February compared to a year earlier. Aldi began as a small food store opened by miner\u2019s wife Anna Albrecht in the German town of Essen in 1914 to support the family when her husband became ill.","highlights":"German discount supermarket Aldi now has a 5.3 per cent market share .\nIn comparison, Waitrose has 5.1 per cent,\u00a0according to consumer research .\nBoth lag behind Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and the Co-Operative .\nThe total market share of the \u2018big four\u2019 fell to its the lowest for a decade .","id":"6d60a42bf59b5acb0bdecbeb333932b02388450f"}
{"article":"The White House doubled down today on President Barack Obama's Earth Day message that climate change is 'a problem now' and knocked political figures who disagree with him as climate deniers and opportunists. 'The preponderance of scientific evidence is on the side of the president in making this argument. And the president believes that to deny the existence of climate change is to deny an observable fact that is substantiated by science,' press secretary Josh Earnest said today after he was asked about a Duke study that claimed the earth isn't heating up as quickly as expected. He then added, without any nudging, 'And there are some who are involved in politics that choose to deny that fact because it's inconvenient to their case and it might be inconvenient to some of their strongest political supporters.' Earnest's channeling of former Vice President Al Gore, star of the 2006 global warming documentary an Inconvenient Truth, followed the president's gas-guzzling, 1,836 mile trip on Wednesday, Earth Day, to the Florida Everglades aboard Air Force One. The White House doubled down today on President Barack Obama's Earth Day message that climate change is 'a problem now' and knocked political figures who disagree with him as climate deniers and opportunists. The president is seen here on Wednesday, Earth Day, boarding Air Force One before departing from Florida. There  he mocked opponents of climate change and said global warming is a 'problem now' There he preached about the harmful effects of global warming on the environment and the economy and mocked skeptics of man-made climate change. 'Climate change can no longer be denied,' he said. 'And action can no longer be delayed.' 'This is a not a problem for another generation. Not anymore. This is a problem now. It has serious implications for the way we live right now.' The president's spokesman did not name-check opponents of Obama's argument on climate change today but it was evident that he was referring to conservatives such as Oklahoma Senator Jim Inhofe. The author of the anti-global warming book, The Greatest Hoax, Inhofe, has been a vocal critic of the administration's environmental policies. In late February he brought a snowball to the upper chamber's floor and presented it as evidence that global warming is a farce. 'It's very, very cold out. Very unseasonable,' Inhofe, chairman of the Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee, said and threw the snowball at the Senate president. Obama scoffed at the Republican lawmaker's antics in his Wednesday speech saying, 'yes, this winter was cold in some parts of this country, including Washington.' 'Some people in Washington helpfully used a snowball to illustrate that fact,' he noted. Taking a shot at Florida Governor Rick Scott, who allegedly banned the phrase climate change from his employees' vernacular, Obama said that 'simply refusing to say the words \"climate changed\" doesn\u2019t mean that climate change isn\u2019t happening.' 'If you\u2019ve got a coming storm, you don\u2019t stick your head in the sand,' he said. 'You prepare for the storm.' He said at another point in his remarks that climate change cannot be 'edited out' or 'omitted from the conversation.' 'There are some who are involved in politics that choose to deny' that global warming is happening 'because it's inconvenient to their case and it might be inconvenient to some of their strongest political supporters,' Obama's spokesman, Josh Earnest, said today . Responding to the question today about the Duke study, Earnest said  'the president is demonstrating genuine leadership by challenging the country and the world to confront [global warming].' Furthermore, he said, the president is going about it in a way that will 'not just safeguard the American people,' but one that can also have 'significant benefits for our economy.' Wind and solar power, he said, do stand to yield long term benefits for the United States' economy if it makes an early investment in alternative energy sources. The president 'is determined to position' the U.S 'so that we can capitalize on those trends,' he said.","highlights":"President 'believes that to deny the existence of climate change is to deny an observable fact that is substantiated by science,' press secretary said .\nHe added: 'And there are some who are involved in politics that choose to deny that fact because it's inconvenient to their case and it might be inconvenient to some of their strongest political supporters'\nRemarks followed the president's gas guzzling, 1,836 mile trip on Wednesday, Earth Day, to the Florida Everglades aboard Air Force One .","id":"b9931377db02ff83a2476627c7c8a257cad25886"}

Though left-footed, Ritchie operates on the right flank and his energy and eye for a goal sum up Eddie Howe's attacking side. A product of Portsmouth's academy, he never got a look-in at Fratton Park and has risen through the lower leagues and now looks destined for the top flight. It was the Scotland international's \u00a3400,000 move to Bournemouth from Swindon in January 2013 that triggered Paolo di Canio's dramatic resignation at the County Ground. Bournemouth winger Matt Ritchie celebrates as Bournemouth beat Birmingham on Easter Monday . Bradley Johnson . Club: Norwich. Position: Midfielder. Age: 27. Games: 38. Goals: 13. Norwich did well to hang on to Johnson after being relegated last summer and if they don't make an immediate return he will surely still be back in the Premier League - where he proved a reliable performer for the three seasons prior to this - come August. A powerful, deep-lying midfielder with a solid all-round game, the ex-Leeds man has added goals to his repertoire this season, scoring more in 38 games than he had in his previous four seasons. Experienced midfielder Bradley Johnson has been in prolific form in front of goal this season . Troy Deeney . Club: Watford. Position: Striker. Age: 26. Games: 37. Goals: 20. Deeney has plundered 63 goals in the Championship in the past three seasons and with his 27th birthday approaching in the summer he surely has to be playing in the Premier League next season. A product of Walsall's academy, Deeney served three months in prison for affray in 2012 and has impressively rebuilt his career and life since. Deeney has been consistently excellent for Watford over the last three seasons . Patrick Bamford . Club: Middlesbrough. Position: Forward. Age: 21. Games: 34. Goals: 15. Having spent spells on loan from Chelsea at MK Dons, Derby and Boro in League One and now the Championship, the next step in Bamford's progression will be in the Premier League next season. If Boro go up, Jose Mourinho will surely be happy for the England Under 21 international to continue under the tutelage of his former No 2 and Boro boss Aitor Karanka. If not, there will be plenty of other suitors for the tall, versatile forward. Patrick Bamford (centre) moved to the Riverside on a season-long loan deal from Chelsea last summer . Will Hughes . Club: Derby. Position: Midfielder. Age: 19. Games: 39. Goals: 2. Not 20 until later this month, Hughes will be a name familiar with many of our readers given his exploits for Gareth Southgate's England Under 21 side, for whom he has 14 caps. Making his debut as a 17-year-old, the elegant left-footed midfielder has already played over 130 times for Derby and has no shortage of admirers among the Premier League's elite. Derby midfielder Will Hughes has plenty of experience despite still being a teenager . Bakary Sako . Club: Wolves. Position: Winger. Age: 26. Games: 36. Goals: 13. When Sako moved to Wolves for \u00a34million from St Etienne he would have had hopes of playing in the Premier League before too long. Instead, he found himself  in League One a year later. To his credit though, he stayed and spearheaded Wolves' romp to the League One title last year and has been the key man in their bid to make it back-to-back promotions. His contract is up this summer and a new one will only be signed if Wolves achieve that. Bakary Sako (centre) has become a cult hero at Molineux but looks certain to leave if Wolves don't go up . Alex Pritchard . Club: Brentford. Position: Attacking midfielder. Age: 21. Games: 41. Goals: 9. Another side bidding for back-to-back promotions are Brentford and Tottenham loanee Pritchard has been key in their surprise success story. Short, agile, quick and versatile, Pritchard is in the Spanish mould of midfielder we have been craving for so long in this country. Given Mauricio Pochettino's track record of developing youth it wouldn't be a surprise to see him in Spurs' squad next season though they may opt to loan him out  to a smaller Premier League club. Alex Pritchard takes on Liverpool's Emre Can during an Under 21 international last month . Tyrone Mings . Club: Ipswich. Position: Left back. Age: 22. Games: 35. Goals: 1. Linked with Arsenal and Crystal Palace in January, Mings' form has tailed off of late with Ipswich's but he has all the attributes required to succeed at the highest level. Tall for a full back at 6ft 5in Mings is nonetheless quick and full of attacking intent. He was let go by both Southampton and Bristol Rovers as a teen before arriving at Ipswich in 2012 via non-league. Giant Ipswich defender Tyrone Mings attracted interest from Premier League clubs in January . We\u2019ve also come up with a composite XI made up by the best players from the eight clubs. This side would surely stay up in the Premier League with ease... Composite XI (4-2-3-1): John Ruddy (Norwich); Dominic Iorfa (Wolves), Russell Martin (Norwich), Steve Cook (Bournemouth), Tyrone Mings (Ipswich); Will Hughes (Derby), Bradley Johnson (Norwich); Matt Ritchie (Bournemouth), Alex Pritchard (Brentford), Bakary Sako (Wolves); Troy Deeney (Watford).","highlights":"Championship top eight separated by just nine points with game to go .\nThree teams will be promoted to the Premier League, with five missing out .\nSportsmail picks out eight players who should be in the Premier League next season whether their club is promoted or not .\nWe have also compiled a composite XI made up from the eight teams .","id":"c65b37e862c5bdc7f7dafb07302e2de02b74f7b7"}
{"article":"Fast food giant Chipotle is making a fresh start and stepping away from using GMOs (genetically modified organisms) as ingredients. Steve Ells, the company's co-CEO and founder, discussed the new development with CNN Money. 'It's relatively easy for us to have all non-GMO ingredients,' he said in the interview. 'I mean, because we don't have many ingredients in the first place.' Scroll down for video . Fresh start: Chipotle co-CEO Steve Ells, pictured, has said 'It's relatively easy for us to have all non-GMO ingredients' Ells added 'You know, we've always paid attention to the way we've sourced food since we started 22 years ago. 'Like artificial colors, additives, preservatives. We'd just rather not be a part of that.' CNNMoney\u00a0reported that the move marks Chipotle as the first GMO-free national fast food chain. Ells said in the interview that the company has 68 total ingredients and another company's burrito features upwards of 80. Rice, meat marinades, chips, salsa, and tortillas will not be made with GMOs -- with non-GMO corn, sunflower oil and rice bran oil now featuring as ingredients, CNNMoney reported. The\u00a0New York Times reported that non-GMO canola oil will also be used. Simplified:\u00a0Ells, seen in a Chipotle kitchen, has said the company has 68 total ingredients -- and another company's burrito features upwards of 80 . On the rise: Last year, the Chipotle's sales reportedly went up 27.8%, and its stock went up approximately 350% over a five-year period . However, CNNMoney noted GMO-feed is consumed by chickens and pigs Chipotle uses. During an interview with the financial news outlet, Ells said farmers are not currently ordered to use non-GMO feed. 'Now this is something that we would like to do eventually,' he explained. 'There just isn't enough non-GMO feed at this point.' Speaking about GMOs, Ells also said 'They say these ingredients are safe, but I think we all know we'd rather have food that doesn't contain them.' Ells addressed Chipotle's shortage of carnitas pork in stores in a separate interview with the\u00a0New York Times. The shortage, the newspaper\u00a0explained, is due to a pork supplier not hitting standards - meaning reduced sales. Ells told the Times 'We're working with our farmers to plan enough of these [non-GMO] crops we need to meet our supply. 'With pork, it's harder because we only need one part of the animal, the shoulder, and the farmer needs to sell the whole animal to make it work.'","highlights":"Chipotle is stepping away from using GMOs (genetically modified organisms) as ingredients .\nThe company's rice, meat marinades, chips, salsa, and tortillas will not be made with GMOs .\nHowever,  GMO-feed is still consumed by the chickens and pigs the company uses .\nChipotle co-CEO Steve Ells has said 'They say these ingredients are safe, but I think we all know we'd rather have food that doesn't contain them'","id":"3572dee55c511d5fd647c1bec89dd866d4ea8644"}
{"article":"A Florida woman who fled with her 4-year-old son to keep his circumcision from going forward has filed a civil rights lawsuit on behalf of the boy. Heather Hironimus, who filed the complaint late Monday, is hoping a federal judge might intervene where state judges haven't. The complaint is repeating her claims that surgery on her 4-year-old son isn't necessary, that the boy doesn't want it, and that his constitutional rights are being violated. Aside from seeking to stop the procedure, Hironimus is trying to avoid her own arrest. Her arrest was ordered after she fled in February and ignored a judge's demand that she appear in court and allow the circumcision to go forward. Mother: Heather Hironimus fled with her son despite a judge's order to appear in court and to allow the circumcision favored by the child's father, Dennis Nebus, to go forward . Father:\u00a0Dennis Nebus right, sits in court with his lawyers May Cain and William Snihur, Jr., in a continuing legal battle with Hironimus over circumcision (March 10, 2015 file photo) Hironimus and the boy's father, Dennis Nebus, have been warring since her pregnancy. They were never married but share custody of their child. In a parenting agreement filed in court, the two agreed to the boy's circumcision. Hironimus later changed her mind, giving way to a long court battle. Circuit and appellate judges have sided with Nebus, but potential surgeons have backed out after failing to get the mother's consent and becoming the target of anti-circumcision protesters. Though circumcision remains popular in Judeo-Christian tradition, religion had not been a driver in seeking the cutting of the boy's foreskin in this case.\u00a0Nebus called it 'just the normal thing to do.' Supporters of Heather Hironiumus, Anthony Mollical and Zeresh Altork, gather outside of the South County Courthouse in Delray Beach where Hironiumus was meant to appear with her child (March 10, 2015 file photo) Fight: Supporters backing Heather Hironimus are seen outside a courthouse on March 10 . In the new filing, though, Hironimus tries to use the child's faith as a defense against the surgery, saying he is a Christian and citing New Testament passages to bolster her case that the practice is discouraged by their beliefs. Both parents have been under a gag order since December. Hironimus' attorney, Thomas Hunker, told the Associated Press that he couldn't reveal where his client was, but that she was fighting on behalf of a child who is frightened by the idea of undergoing surgery. Given the boy's age and the fact that he has voiced his own opposition to circumcision, Hunker said, the procedure could be particularly scarring. 'This could have a profound negative impact, a long-lasting if not permanent negative impact, on the child's psychological condition,' he said Tuesday. Hunker did not return a message seeking comment from Daily Mail Online. Attorneys representing Nebus declined to comment to Daily Mail Online, citing the order. An attorney for Nebus did not return a call seeking comment from the Associated Press. Circumcision rates have fallen in the U.S., but a majority of boys still undergo the procedure. Meantime, a bubbling movement of so-called anti-circumcision 'intactivists' has made the case a rallying cry against a surgery they view as barbaric.","highlights":"Heather Hironimus and the boy's father, Dennis Nebus, have been warring since her pregnancy .\nThey were never married but share custody of their 4-year-old child .\nIn a parenting agreement filed in court, the two agreed to the boy's circumcision .\nHironimus\u00a0later changed her mind, giving way to a long court battle .\nShe filed a federal civil rights complaint late Monday .\nIt repeats the claims that surgery on her 4-year-old son isn't necessary, that the boy doesn't want it, and that his constitutional rights are being violated .\nHironimus is also trying to avoid her own arrest .\nThe arrest\u00a0was ordered after she fled in February and ignored a judge's demand that she appear in court and allow the surgery to go forward .","id":"4cbc07cf6047d4e8c7d84608ad2c8f1b40dc5264"}
{"article":"Steve Clarke admits his Reading side require the \u2018perfect\u2019 performance to stand any chance of beating Arsenal \u2014 but concedes he has yet to see that from one of his teams during his managerial career. Reading have struggled in the Championship this campaign whereas Arsene Wenger\u2019s side are the in-form side in the Premier League going into their FA Cup semi-final at Wembley on Saturday. \u2018There\u2019s only the pressure that we put ourselves under to play the perfect game and make no mistakes,\u2019 said Clarke. Steve Clarke insists his Reading side must be 'perfect' to have any chance of beating Arsenal at Wembley . \u2018We must make sure that the preparation and mentality are right and we give everything we\u2019ve got. \u2018We\u2019ve mentioned about having no regrets coming off the pitch and I promise you the players will give everything they\u2019ve got to try to get a result. \u2018We have to play almost the perfect game \u2014 to be solid, resolute and mentally strong. It\u2019s a game where we can\u2019t make too many mistakes. If you make mistakes against the top teams they will punish you. If we can do that we\u2019ve got a chance.\u2019 Clarke, 51, is still feeling his way as a manager, having taken charge of West Bromwich Albion for a season in 2012 before taking the Reading job last summer.

Asked how many times he had seen a perfect display from one of his sides, he replied: \u2018Probably none, so it\u2019s a big ask. But you have to ask it.\u2019 Clarke has never beaten Wenger and added: \u2018I had a couple of good games against them at West Brom. I know they are a good team with good players but if we play the perfect game we have a chance.\u2019 Clarke has challenged his players to make history by getting to the FA Cup final for the first time. Eighty-eight years ago they made it to this stage but Clarke is not content with matching that. \u2018It\u2019s not unique history, it\u2019s shared history,\u2019 he said. \u2018If they get to the final, no other Reading team has done that.

{"article":"Virgil van Dijk believed he had sampled the worst refereeing decision of his career the night he landed an early red card against Inter Milan. Events at Hampden on Sunday forced him to revise his opinion. In the aftermath of a contentious Scottish Cup semi-final defeat to Inverness Caledonian Thistle, the Dutchman found sleep elusive. The claims of referee Steven McLean and his five assistants that they failed to see the handball by Inverness player Josh Meekings which denied Celtic a penalty, a red card, possibly even a crack at the Treble, struck many at Parkhead as dubious. So dubious they fired off a letter seeking clarification from the SFA. Celtic centre back\u00a0Virgil van Dijk leaves field following his side's\u00a03-2 to Inverness in the Scottish Cup semi-final . For van Dijk, the collective burst of myopia was remarkable. A greater lapse on a wider scale than the red card he received from Slovakian official Ivan Kruzliak in the last 32 of the Champions League in February; a decision he described at the time as the worst he had experienced. Resting his arms on a table in a Glasgow hotel after being shortlisted for the PFA Scotland player of the year award, the Dutchman said of the Meekings flashpoint: 'Yeah I saw it. I think everybody in the stadium saw everything. It' s very strange that the right decision wasn't made. 'I was maybe near the halfway line. Even in the stands you could see it. It was a miracle that we didn't get the right decision. Van Dijk netted a superb free-kick against Caley Thistle but it wasn't enough to secure victory . 'This decision was terrible. I don't know \u2013 I've experienced some decisions lately. The Inter Milan game, of course, was terrible for my feelings. 'The decision on Sunday wasn't right and everyone can see it. It's terrible when you think about it . 'It was harder on my feelings (than Milan). I put the ref in a position in Milan to give me a red card (following his challenges on Rodrigo Palacio and Mauro Icardi) and that's what I have to learn from. 'Sunday's was a clear decision and it wasn't made - and that's a worse feeling.' Wednesday's 2-1 Premiership win over Dundee helped. It carried Celtic another step closer to the title and was recuperative. The presence of two Parkhead players \u2013 van Dijk and Stefan Johansen \u2013 on the PFA Scotland shortlist suggests the season may yet redeem itself. Josh Meekings handled Leigh Griffiths goal-bound header but none of the officials saw it . Van Dijk is clear that punishing the Inverness player would have been futile and pointless. The blame for what happened lies, he believes, with the officials who created the mess and then closed ranks to insist they simply hadn't seen it. Former Celtic striker Chris Sutton has called on the officials to be held to account. But when SFA the freeze out their officials, it's done behind closed doors, quietly and without ceremony. 'I don't know,' said van Dijk, 'I don't think I can give my opinion on that. I want to move forward as well. We're not in the final. I want to win the league as soon as possible so we need to win on Sunday and move forward. My feeling is you shouldn't be punished for someone else's mistake.' Ronny Deila described the circumstances of the defeat to Inverness as the worst of his career. The Celtic manager returned home to stare at the walls while, for van Dijk, counting sheep proved an inadequate antidote to insomnia. 'Everybody was very down, especially after the game. For myself personally I was devastated, especially during the night, I couldn't sleep that well. 'That was the biggest chance to get the Treble and everyone at Celtic, and I think around Celtic as well, had the feeling that it was going to happen. 'If the right decision had been made in the game on Sunday we would have been in the final and we would hopefully have won the final. 'The Treble was very close. But it's not going to be turned around any more.' There are five games left now to change perceptions of the season. Celtic expect to win the league. With five games left and an eight-point lead over Aberdeen, they are almost there. Thereafter what transpires between Falkirk and Inverness in the Hampden final on May 30 is a source of utter indifference for the likes of van Dijk. 'I go on holiday so I don't think i will see it,' he said. 'After this season I don't want to watch any football. I've been the whole year watching and playing football and I have to be mentally rested for next season. I don't think I will watch it.' From the comfort of a Dubai lounger, he may give a little more time to his own future. Nominated for a second successive season by PFA Scotland, there are times when the Scottish game looks a little too easy for the 23-year-old defender. For the sake of his own development, there is the expectation he will leave Celtic this summer. Ronny Deila was angry at the referee's decision to now send off Meekings and award his side a penalty . Parrying questions on the matter, he insisted: 'My thoughts are that I want to win the league as soon as possible. 'We'll see what happens in the summer but for now I'm a Celtic player and we'll see if that is or isn't the case after the summer. 'It's an amazing club and you don't want to leave a club like this for one that is not as big. 'You need to know what you want \u2013 you don't need to lie. You have to be straight. I will be straight with everyone. 'I'm focusing on the present. You never know what will happen but for now I'm enjoying being a Celtic player.' His dilemma is clear. Celtic are a large club in a small league. Asked if a smaller club in a large league like England would be worth leaving for, he said: 'It depends on the club. If Celtic was playing in the Premier league then they would be one of the best clubs in the world and to stay here would be much more interesting than anything else. 'It is what it is right now. I just want to win the league as soon as possible and hopefully get a nice game maybe before we have to go to Aberdeen. Or maybe Aberdeen away will be a nice place to win the championship\u2026'","highlights":"Celtic crashed lost to 3-2 to Inverness in the\u00a0Scottish Cup semi-final .\nThe referee failed to spot a handball from Inverness player Josh Meekings .\nThe decision denied Celtic a penalty during a crucial point of the game .\nVan Dijk was sent off against Inter Milan in the last 32 of the Champions League in February .","id":"1cb63a1c243aa99a83569985dfe49f09ab7792eb"}
{"article":"When Adam Lyons' story was published last week, many were stunned by his polyamorous relationship and how he gets to share his life - and his bed - with two beautiful women. Now his girlfriends Brooke Shedd, 26, and Jane Shalakhova, 25, have spoken out to say they are just as fortunate as the 34-year-old who hails from East London. The women say they do not 'share' Adam but are in a 'unique' situation where they both love him - as well as each other. Scroll down for video . Brooke, right, and Jane appeared on today's This Morning with boyfriend Adam to explain how their\u00a0polyamorous relationship works and makes them all happy . The trio appeared on today's This Morning to set the record straight about their relationship after it caused a stir when it hit the headlines last week. 'I don't look at it as me sharing Adam, it's me sharing myself with Adam and Jane,'\u00a0Brooke told intrigued presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford. 'It's three people who fell for each other and into this unique situation.' Brooke has a five-year-old son, Oliver, from a previous relationship and has just had another baby, Dant\u00e9, with Adam. They will raise the boys in Los Angeles with Russian-born Jane, who joined their open relationship after the three of them hit it off so well. The trio explained their open relationship to presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford via a video link from their home in LA . Brooke, from Texas, explained: 'We're weren't looking to add a third person to our relationship when we met Jane, we just enjoyed going out and meeting women. But Jane fell in perfectly and it was serendipitous.' The trio all live together and share a super king-sized bed and Brooke said there's no jealousy between them as they are all in love. Jane agreed that if she ever feels jealousy, it's never over Brooke spending time with Adam but because the pair are having fun without her. She explained: 'When I get jealous, it's me jealous of missing out if I'm at work and not physically with them, it's my two best friends hanging out and I'm not there.' Adam said their relationship works because all parties knew where they stood at the outset. Jane and Brooke say they do not 'share' Adam and are as much in love with each other as they are with him . He said: 'Brooke and I knew when we first met we were open to the possibility of having other women in our relationship. 'It's not that I have two girlfriends, it's that there are three of us in a relationship.' He added: 'I get to hang out with my two best friends every day. We get questioned a lot about whether we're intimate all together. Most of the time it is all three of us. We like to enjoy the benefits of our unique relationship.' Adam revealed his friends and family in the UK are astounded at how he's transformed into a charming lady's man - as at his East London school, he was a 'loser' once voted the least likely to get a girlfriend. The unconventional family are raising two children - Brooke and Adam's newborn, Dante, and Brooke's son Oliver from a previous relationship. Jane is keen to have a baby with Adam in the future too . But he said he gained in confidence after becoming a dating coach and learning techniques to help make himself more attractive. As a result, he says he's not worried if his open relationship leads to Brooke or Jane leaving him for someone else. 'One of the cool things about the journey I have taken is I now have the confidence to meet other women if my partner moves on, so I will move on,' he said. The trio admitted that all their families find their situation bizarre but all are supportive because they know they are so happy and in love. Jane said: 'Imagine you meet your soul mate, now multiply that by two! It's twice the love.' Following the interview Eamonn joked to wife Ruth that perhaps they should consider introducing a woman into their relationship - but she told him it would never happen.","highlights":"Adam Lyons, 34, from East London, is in a relationship with two women .\nHis girlfriends Brooke, 26, and Jane, 25, say they do not 'share' him .\nThey are all in love with one another .\nTrio appeared on today's This Morning to explain why relationship works .","id":"ec932855b2660f964dc2f76b594b312281b04144"}

Mr Guven is the supervisor of site security at Lone Pine, the hilltop battlefield cemetery that will host the second Australian dawn service on Anzac Day. And while there have been questions about security at Gallipoli following recent terror arrests in Australia and ongoing instability in Syria, Mr Guven is quietly confident. 'The army is here, we are here. It will be okay,' he said. Cengiz G\u00fcven (left) with actor Russell Crowe in Istanbul during the premiere of Crowe's film The Water Divider . The 30-year-old security guard pictured with Aerosmith lead singer Steven Tyler . The 30-year-old security manager from Istanbul has been taking care of things at Lone Pine for the past four years, but in between Anzac Days his work has a superstar flavour. When Crowe attended the Istanbul premiere of his latest film, The Water Diviner, in 2014, Mr Guven was on personal protection duty. He kept Tyler safe when the frontman and his band were in town to perform and has been on duty for Campbell, American lifestyle icon Martha Stewart and electro-dance group The Prodigy. Switching from one-on-one to protecting thousands doesn't faze Mr Guven, even when the 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings has made this year the busiest ever for him and his team from Turkish security firm VipSec.

The civilian security team, which will handle bag and entry checks for 8000 Australians at the Lone Pine service on Anzac Day, is just a part of the enormous security machine that has swung into operation across the Gallipoli peninsula. Nearly 4000 national and paramilitary police, and at least 1000 Turkish soldiers will be on duty when the memorial sites are locked down over Friday and Saturday.

Last weekend Roux was reportedly due to be helping his son Michel Jr cook at tennis star Andy Murray\u2019s wedding reception at the Cromlix House hotel in Scotland. Instead he whisked Ms Lutsyshyna off on a romantic getaway to the South of France where they dined at the Michelin-starred Joel Robuchon Monte-Carlo restaurant. \u2018Albert went to a lot of trouble to treat Nataliya,\u2019 a friend of the chef said.

Debbie Spivey Izo (left), an American divorcee in her 60s whom he dated before his marriage and Lynne Moore (right) who says she has been invited to 'half a dozen dinners' Mr Roux, who once confessed to giving up on his childhood dream of becoming a priest due to his philandering, started stepping out with Ms Lutsyshyna last year after The Mail on Sunday revealed that his wife was divorcing him on the grounds of adultery. At the time, Mr Roux admitted he had seen Miss Lutsyshyna \u2018a week, maybe ten days before the end of the marriage\u2019. Mr Roux, who divorced his first wife Monique, the mother of his two children \u2013 Michel Jr, and Danielle \u2013 in 2001, is said to have spent thousands on his new girlfriend. Says a source: \u2018Some of Albert\u2019s friends are very concerned about the amount of money that he is frittering away.\u2019 However, while he is in an exclusive romantic relationship with Miss Lutsyshyna, she is not the only woman in his life. Ms Spivey Izo reappeared on the scene soon after Mr Roux\u2019s split with Cheryl. She flew to Scotland to see Mr Roux at his establishments there soon after he became a single man again. \u2018Debbie has been on the scene for years,\u2019 adds a source. \u2018She was dating Albert before he met Cheryl and she never really went away. As soon as his marriage to Cheryl ended, Albert was back in touch with her.\u2019 Lynne Moore, who met Albert Roux through Lib Dem peer Lord Sharman, admitted to The Mail on Sunday that they regularly meet up: \u2018Albert has kindly invited me to about half a dozen dinners. 'He\u2019s very nice, but we are not in a romantic relationship.\u2019 Mr Roux has known Ljiljana Pavicevic, since 2008. She and Roux they often enjoy dinners together. When contacted by The Mail on Sunday, Ms Pavicevic, who is known as Lily, said: \u2018I see Mr Roux with other colleagues, I have never had a dinner alone with him.\u2019 Last night Cheryl declined to comment. A spokesman for Mr Roux said: \u2018He has no comment to make on this. He tries to be extremely private.\u2019","highlights":"Albert Roux has been dating a string of ladies since divorcing heiress wife .\nThey include a Ukrainian cloakroom attendant, an artist and a tea hostess .\nThe 79-year-old is said to have spent thousands on one of the women .\nLast year it emerged his wife was divorcing him on grounds of adultery .","id":"ed53c585a0f19c3981dfe9c0e845724b32f4cd9a"}
{"article":"With every new milestone, many may find themselves nostalgically looking back upon their life and career choices. As expected, not everyone will feel satisfied with the decisions they've made \u00a0that they have made the right decisions. But this affects women more so than men, a new survey has revealed. A new survey has revealed that women regret their career choices more than men. With 47% compared to only 40% of men . According to specialist travel agency Planet Cruise, women regret their career choices more so than men. Just under half (47 per cent) of women aged over 55 expressed disappointment over their decisions, compared to just 40 per cent of men. More alarming is the fact that nearly half of women (47 per cent) surveyed admitted that they have suffered from a mental illness or negative feelings towards their roles. For men, the figure was even higher, with 52 per cent having suffered from mental issues. Furthermore, one in five over-55s surveyed admitted to feelings of depression due to a missed opportunity at work. Similar ranking figures showed that people had also dealt with isolation, or unsociable and distant feelings as a result. The survey, from specialist travel agency, Planet Cruise, was conducted on people age over 55 and exposed widespread career disappointments among both men and women . More than a quarter surveyed also revealed that they wished that they had thrown caution to the wind and taken more risks in their careers. Specifically, one in ten admitted that they regretted not being more tenacious with pursuing promotions and being more ambitious in general. Women were also more likely to feel like their relationships had held them back in their careers. And 17 per cent of women felt some sort of resentment towards their partners - indicating that they held them responsible for a career regret or missed opportunity. 10% of women surveyed admitted that they regretted not having more children, compared with only 6% men . But only ten per cent of men admitted to feeling the same way. These regrets didn't only stem from people's careers, but sadly extended to personal choices too. More men than women (22 per cent compared to just 11 per cent) wished they hadn't worked so much, and had spent more time with their children. Just ten per cent of females regretted not having more children - indicating that career pressures had limited the amount of time they had available - compared to only six per cent of men. More men than women (15% compared to 10%) regretted not dating more before they settled down. More men regretted not dating more before they settled down - with 15 per cent admitting this, compared to just 10 per cent of women. From 6 April onward, the UK's new pension reforms allow over-55s to have more freedom with their pension. The  survey exposed widespread regrets within that specific age group. A spokesperson for Planet Cruise commented: 'Work can consume our entire lives. As we get older, we reflect upon opportunities in life which may have passed us by. 'Everyone has regrets in life and, in this case, women admit to this more than men.'","highlights":"Research conducted by Planet Cruise surveyed people aged 55 and over .\nWomen were more likely to regret their career choices than men .\nMen were more likely to suffer from mental illness as a result of regrets .","id":"d85726288d89a75ce029bd1595eb37ec914c5789"}

Her eldest daughter's newfound freedom had reminded the first lady that not having dirven herself in seven years she had forgotten how to. When Malia asked her mom about how to park in a public parking lot, the first last admitted she was stumped. 'I barely know now too so I have to check with other sources,' she said. The first lady also discussed a Time magazine article which named Malia and sister Sasha among the 25 Most Influential Teens of 2014. 'I don't know why \u2014 they're not influential, they just live here!' she joked. 'They have done nothing to gain any influence.'

'When they get a little snarky, I'm like, 'Oh, you sound like your dad!'' Tens of thousands of people gathered on the White House South Lawn on Monday for the annual Easter egg roll festivities. This year's theme is #GimmeFive, which is part of Mrs. Obama's campaign to try to get young people to be more active and lead healthier lives. Monday's events included sports and fitness zones, cooking demonstrations, and of course, the traditional egg roll. The egg roll is one of the longest-standing White House traditions. In 1878, President Rutherford B. Hayes opened the White House grounds to local children for egg rolling.

The First Family has kicked off this year's Easter celebrations on Sunday with a visit to the Alfred Street Baptist Church in Alexandria, Virginia. Rev Howard-John Wesley had opened the service by welcoming the president, before urging the congregation not to take selfies with him. 'How fitting that on the day we celebrate the rising of our Lord and savior, we also welcome our sitting president,' Wesley said, as the congregation rose to their feet in applause. 'This is not selfie time,' Wesley said jokingly. 'Let the brother worship in the house of God.' Churchgoers traditionally walk around to shake hands and give hugs during the greetings and announcements portion of service, but the pastor encouraged the crowd to stay in their seats and greet only their closest neighbors, as the sanctuary was tightly secured with Secret Service agents. The choir - including women in purple dresses and men sporting purple ties - sang a lively rendition of the hymn 'He Lives,' stirring most of the church, filled to capacity, to clap, sing and sway in praise alongside the upbeat organ keys while ushers collected the tithes and offering. Singalong: The family (pictured in the second row of the congregation) joined in with upbeat hymns . People queued around the block for the service in Alexandria, monitored by federal security officers . The lively pastor based his sermon around a scripture from 1 Corinthians 15 on the life and resurrection of Christ. 'Where do you stand in the resurrection of Christ,' he asked. 'You either believe it or reject it.' Wesley said the sacrifices of Christ allowed the congregation to be forgiven for their own sins. 'He took the pain for me. I owe him my life. I owe him my praise. I owe him my hallelujah,' he said. Appearing on Jimmy Fallon's talk show this week, the first lady revealed that she and her husband will be performing a routine with So You Think You Can Dance contestants on the front lawn of the White House during the annual Easter Egg Roll. It will be to the tune of Uptown Funk. Michelle said she has been practicing the dance, called Gimme Five!, for over a year in the hope that it will inspire children to exercise.

The toddlers are believed to have fallen in the water accidentally at 9.45am on Friday in Yuma, Arizona. After a police search that lasted more than an hour, the brothers were pulled from the water.

Tragic: Twin 18-month-old boys died after accidentally falling in a canal in Arizona on Friday morning . Detectives investigating the case believe the boys ended up in the canal by accident and don't suspect foul play, Franklin said. The area along the canal is used by families for walks and by joggers and a family member was nearby when the boys ended up in the water. Franklin would not provide details of the events that led up to the toddlers ending up in the canal. Yuma Fire Department spokesman Mike Erfert said their crews were called out on a possible drowning. Helicopters from the U.S. Border Patrol and the Marine Corps also flew over the canal searching for the boys. The Border Patrol helicopter crew spotted the brothers in the water, Erfert said, and they were pulled out at about 11.20am. Paramedics began immediate life-saving efforts and the boys were quickly loaded onto the Marine Corps helicopter for the trip to the hospital.","highlights":"The brothers are believed to have fallen in the water by accident .\nPolice searched water from 9.45am to 11.45am before finding them .\nThey were flown to Yuma hospital where they were pronounced dead .","id":"b4996af7d4a0ef34b090e318c8eb1db984e46c4e"}
{"article":"(CNN)Atop the Amazon bestselling books list this month sat an unexpected title: \"Secret Garden.\" It wasn't Frances Hodgson Burnett's 1911 novel about a sour little girl's magical place, making a book club comeback. It was a similarly named coloring book that adults were buying, for themselves, and it wasn't the only one in the top 10. Johanna Basford's \"Secret Garden: An Inky Treasure Hunt & Coloring Book\" (now at No. 3 on Amazon) along with her second effort, \"Enchanted Forest: An Inky Quest & Coloring Book\" (No. 6); \"Balance (Angie's Extreme Stress Menders Volume 1)\" by Angie Grace (No. 9); and \"The Mindfulness Colouring Book: Anti-stress Art Therapy for Busy People\" by Emma Farrarons (No. 8 on Amazon UK) are selling at a rapid clip. Though they can be used by kids, these and other new coloring book titles are being marketed to stressed-out, work-addled adults, who want to benefit from the quiet zen that a coloring session can bring. \"Adult coloring is absolutely a growing trend and consumers are really taking to the idea,\" Farrarons' U.S. publisher, Matthew Lore of The Experiment publishing group, wrote in an email. \"Not only is it calming and good for your health, it's just fun! The demand is increasing exponentially as the word spreads.\" While Farrarons and Basford are based in the UK, the concept is taking off in the U.S. too, with the publication of titles like Virginia-based art therapist Lacy Mucklow and illustrator Angela Porter's \"Color Me Calm\" and \"Color Me Happy,\" created for the minds and motor skills of Mom and Dad, not the kids. The trend doesn't seem to be letting up. Basford is working on a third title, Farrarons has been commissioned for a second book, and Mucklow and Porter will release \"Color Me Stress-Free\" in September. Adults have long used crafts to unwind, but why coloring books? Why now? It may have something to do with online access -- and, funnily enough, the desire to unplug. Ordering a coloring book that suits adult tastes online is easier than walking into a bookstore where the only options have Barbie or Thomas the Tank Engine themes. Plus, everyone's favorite online crafting hub, Pinterest, is a treasure trove of adult coloring pages, with themes ranging from nature and animals to classic paintings. Meanwhile, like children, adults need a break from screen time -- and many are rediscovering the analog pleasures of coloring inside the lines. \"I'm a grown-up, but I still love coloring books,\" novelist Matt Cain proclaimed in a piece for The Guardian. \"If I switch off the phone, computer and TV and concentrate solely on choosing the right shade of blue, avoiding going over the lines and slowly filling up my page with colour, all my other concerns, I've discovered, fade to nothing,\" Cain wrote. The therapeutic benefits of art are nothing new; it's a concept that practitioners use with patients of all ages. Atlanta-based art therapist Susanne Fincher, who has published several coloring books, said coloring can lift the mood, reduce anxiety and relieve stress. \"Art making is a powerful intervention,\" Fincher wrote in an email. \"Neuroscientific research has shown that through the use of art therapy, the human brain can physically change, grow, and rejuvenate.\" True art therapy, she warned, should be administered only by a qualified professional. Mindfulness and meditative coloring are recurring themes in the growing adult coloring book industry. A search for \"adult coloring books\" on Amazon or Barnes and Noble will yield several books of mandalas, a ritual symbol in Buddhism and Hinduism that represents the universe, waiting to be colored in. \"I sometimes give clients one of my mandala coloring books for homework between sessions with me,\" Fincher wrote. \"Coloring mandalas can empower a client to manage thoughts and feelings on their own with the positive activity of coloring, instead of, for example, overeating or abusing substances.\" The opportunity to craft a mindfulness coloring book for adults was serendipitous for illustrator Farrarons, who had been practicing mindfulness for a few years before getting the offer to create a book. \"In mindfulness, it is encouraged to break patterns in life by introducing variation to avoid the sensation of being on autopilot,\" Farrarons wrote in an email while on holiday in Korea. \"Each page has been caringly designed with this in mind, so that the person coloring can hop at random from one pattern to the next. \" Coloring books like Farrarons' pocket-sized volume bring a bit of calming and spirituality to the masses, but for some adult enthusiasts coloring is just a fun throwback to a simpler time, she added. \"It reminds me of hours spent filling in scenes from a coloring book as a little girl. In the digital age that we are in, surely, it can only be a good thing to pick up a pencil and feel young again.\"","highlights":"Coloring books made for adults are popular on Amazon's bestselling books list .\nBooks with calming, meditative and spiritual themes appeal to adults looking to unwind .","id":"ec71c98fe6585e971039144aa70e8a4c94c1839d"}
{"article":"Bridget Klecker, 42, died on Friday after being struck by a vehicle fleeing the police in San Francisco . A pedestrian was killed and another injured when they were struck by a car fleeing police during a wild chase through San Francisco, and the suspects involved were still on the loose Saturday. Officers tried to stop the suspects' stolen car around 10pm on Friday just moments after they committed the latest in a series of robberies while armed with handguns, police said. But the car sped off with police in pursuit and struck a woman in a crosswalk, killing her. The San Francisco medical examiner's office identified the woman on Saturday as Bridget Klecker, 42, of San Francisco. 'I just kept saying that this can't be real \u2014 this just can't be real,' Kristine Mendoza, 35, who described Klecker as her close friend, told the San Francisco Chronicle. She and Klecker had planned to attend Monday's San Francisco Giants home opener together and were heading to Mexico in two weeks on a trip, she said. Witnesses who were riding a cable car saw the black sedan go airborne, and the windshield was badly damaged, according to KGO-TV. The car later hit a second pedestrian and then crashed into another car before slipping away from police in the South of Market neighborhood. 'It was one of those unreal experiences to see a car speeding in the intersection at us like that,' Micaela Davis, 35, a passenger in the car that was struck, told the Chronicle. Davis said the suspects' vehicle ran a red light and the driver of the car she was in swerved to avoid it. Neither she, the driver nor a second passenger was injured. A close friend of Klecker (right) said that the pair were supposed to go to the San Francisco Giants season opener on Monday . Klecker was in a crosswalk at California and Kearny streets (pictured) when the car struck her. She died at the hospital . The black 2013 Toyota Corolla was found unattended on Treasure Island off the Bay Bridge, police said. The three men who were in it were still at large as of Friday night. Police were not able to give a comment of the status of the suspects on Saturday. The second person struck was taken to a hospital with injuries that were not considered life-threatening, police said. Two firearms believed to be thrown from the car during the chase were recovered. The suspects have committed several armed robberies during the last three days, including three on Friday night alone, police said. A white sedan was struck and totaled by the fleeing Toyota after it hit Klecker and another pedestrian. The Toyota Corolla was later found abandoned . The suspects are allegedly responsible for several armed robberies across San Francisco, including three on Friday night .","highlights":"Officers were trying to stop suspects in a stolen black Toyota Friday night after they allegedly committed a series of armed robberies .\nThe car struck and killed Bridget Klecker, 42, in a crosswalk .\nCar hit and injured a second pedestrian and struck a car before fleeing .\nCar was found unattended later that night and three male suspects were still at large as of Friday .","id":"c3457bc5a4437e5b9347d310da5e5046a97716c3"}

Though having completed a 3,000-mile bicycle ride across the USA last year, not to mention a cross-country ski marathon and a four-mile swimming race in a Turkish tidal shipping strait, it's likely she's already much fitter than most. Ever the style maven, even the pink laces in her running shoes matched the Nike tick on her sports cap, while the lead on her earphones appeared to be a part of the colour coordinated ensemble too . A keen athlete, Pippa, who won a sports scholarship to Marlborough College, has previously spoken about how she likes to stay strong and healthy with plenty of exercise and protein-rich diet. Ahead of her swim in Istanbul last summer, the columnist said, 'To maintain energy I try to eat more protein, particularly fish or chicken. 'A lot of people swear by carb-loading in the run-up to an event but it doesn't really work for me, so I just up my protein intake.' Pippa Middleton was seen enjoying an early evening run in a London park earlier this week, stopping along her route to chat to a friendly fellow jogger . Pippa has also revealed that she prefers to stick to \u2018wholesome carbs\u2019 such as brown rice, lentils and quinoa, to balance her increased protein intake. On the morning of big events, she tucks into a bowl of porridge with honey, banana and nuts to provide her body with plenty of fuel. A big fan of the healthy lifestyle, Pippa has also revealed that playing tennis and taking Pilates classes helps her to keep in shape. Miss Middleton has previously revealed how she sticks to 'wholesome carbs' and protein such as chicken and fish when preparing for sporting events .

The collection  featured black satin and emerald crepe fabrics amongst the fishnet overlays and captured the on-trend netting style seen in sport luxe looks, but adding a sophisticated, edge to the smouldering models. Satin show stopper: Black satin was used in conjunction with fishnet fabric to add sexy, edge to Keating show . Oversized office attire: Models wore lose black and white pants and men style shirts in the Khim Hang show . The Alice McCall show also grabbed the audience's attention in a clearly visual punk representation, with colourful, tattoos displayed across the back of a catwalk model. The model wore a open backed top, which clearly highlighted the punk-rock tattoos, a obvious statement rebelling against the fashion norm, in what follows throughout the gritty collection. Contrasting the tattoo laden model, another model mimics a prom Barbie, with innocent blonde locks and a satin pink frock, but is fast made punk with smoky eyes reminiscent of the heroine chic look.

The model  is also seen to lose one of her sleeves mid-catwalk in what's not is a mistake or a obvious tribute to her late night, rolled-out-of a-gutter chic look. The last triumphant punk  look came from Western Australian design duo Zhivago. Zhivago's Lara Kovacevich and Lydia Tsvetnenko swapped rag-doll, wet look hair for bold, black, cut-throat bob-cut wigs, in what can be described as a killer geisha models. All that glitters: Models wear  gold asymmetrical dress (left) and contrasting muted grey (right) at Toni Maticevski . White out: It was all about crisp, textured whites at the Haryono Setiadi show . Wearing leather harnessed stiletto heels, striking black wigs, high-cut asymmetrical dresses and arm cuffs the collection was a strong edition to the modern punk look on display. Models also were seen to have dark eye lined eyes and dominant brushed eyebrows. The remaining designers that presented including Jason Brunsdon, Toni Maticveski, Ginger and Smart,Michael Lo Sordo and One Fell Swoop chose to take a more safe approach, sticking with classic couture - with frills, pastels, draping and long-line gowns.

{"article":"Geoff Whitington, 63, from Ashford, Kent, was made so sick by obesity-related type 2 diabetes that he had been told he may need a leg amputated . It is a toe-curling moment that many have faced: the supermarket tantrum. And Geoff Whitington, pouting and shouting, performs it with aplomb. 'I don't want to!' is the cry when he is asked if he will try whelks. Despite the wobbly bottom lip and huffy, crossed arms, Geoff happens to be a 63-year-old father of four grown-up children. And in this bizarre episode of role-reversal, it is his sons, Anthony and Ian, who are gently \u2013 some might say valiantly \u2013 trying to broaden his palate. The problem will be all too familiar to anyone who has broached the subject of healthier eating with a parent who might not have the most up-to-date ideas about diet. But the Whitington boys are motivated by a matter of life and death. For years, Geoff was ill, made so sick by obesity-related type 2 diabetes that he had been told he may need a leg amputated. Turning round his health would mean changing the habits of a lifetime of poor food choices and no exercise. And Geoff resisted with a passion. While many would have admitted defeat in the face of his almost insurmountable stubbornness, the two brothers overhauled their father's health, and crucially, his attitude. And in doing so, they have undoubtedly saved his life. Anthony and Ian have helped their father shed six stone and now, two years after that tantrum in the supermarket, Geoff is a man transformed. He loves to cycle, never eats take-aways and counts kale and couscous among his favourite foods. Most remarkably, doctors say he is no longer diabetic \u2013 and he is off medication. The supermarket stand-off was caught on camera for a forthcoming film called Fixing Dad, a searingly honest but moving account of the Whitingtons' journey, which has already won coveted slots at film festivals. The brothers have a lifelong passion for film \u2013 Ian, 35, is a full-time film-maker \u2013 so they decided to document their battle to inspire others to do the same. Anthony, 37, says: 'He wasn't old, but Dad had given up on himself. He blamed himself for his illness but didn't think he could do anything about it. Getting a grown man to change his ways is difficult and there were times when it felt like it was pointless, but we knew we had to carry on. Just the thought of losing him spurred us on.' Luckily for Geoff, his sons are just as stubborn as he used to be, and their plan has been a huge success. 'The difference in Dad is incredible and he is proof that it's never too late,' says Anthony, a father-of-four from Ashford, Kent. 'Physically, he's gone from having to use crutches to get around to taking on 100-mile cycle challenges. Mentally he's a new person \u2013 he had retreated into himself and was probably depressed.' Scroll down for video . His sons Anthony and Ian (right) helped the father-of-four shed six stone and overhauled his health . He turned his life around and remarkably, doctors say he is no longer diabetic \u2013 and he is off medication . Geoff, who lives in Ashford with second wife Marilyn, works 15-hour night shifts as a security guard. Before his sons intervened, his exercise routine was non-existent and he tipped the scales at 20 stone. He existed on a high-fat, high-sugar diet. Sometimes he'd eat three takeaway meals a day. Anthony, a corporate financial adviser, says: 'He had an old-fashioned mentality that cooking was a woman's domain, so he'd opt for something convenient and quick. Marilyn would cook him healthy dinners but Dad would sneak in a takeaway on the way home.' Geoff's weight problems were worrying enough, but there was the added complication of his type 2 diabetes, which affects more than 2.7 million Britons. If left untreated, the condition can leave a person up to five times more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke, and at risk of foot problems due to nerve damage and poor circulation. Rates of type 2 diabetes are soaring due to increasing obesity, unhealthy diets, a lack of exercise and an ageing population. Geoff was first diagnosed with diabetes in 2003. But it wasn't until a visit to a podiatrist in August 2013 that the gravity of his situation was laid bare. 'Dad had an ulcer that was giving him a lot of discomfort,' Anthony says. 'He was having to use crutches and going to have the ulcer cleaned and dressed on a regular basis. 'Things had got so bad that the podiatrist told Dad there was a risk he might lose his leg if he carried on as he was. Until then, in his mind having diabetes was just popping a few more pills in addition to ones he was already on for his high blood pressure and cholesterol. This was the wake-up call we all needed.' He now loves to cycle, never eats take-aways and counts kale and couscous among his favourite foods . Anthony and Ian knew drastic action was needed. 'Dad obviously had weight issues which we'd talked about in the past, but we had busy lives so didn't really push it as far as we could have done,' says Anthony. Step one was to overhaul Geoff's diet. Out went the convenience foods and in came a strict two-month, 800 calorie-a-day diet under the watchful eye of professor Roy Taylor at Newcastle University. He is conducting a study, funded by charity Diabetes UK, which aims to see if a low-calorie diet can permanently reverse type 2 diabetes. Step two was to encourage Geoff to be more active, to improve his fitness and outlook on life. 'We wanted him to find a social life and hobby other than work and food \u2013 we've done everything from fishing to t'ai chi,' Anthony says. 'But we knew he had to take up an achievable form of exercise that didn't put pressure on his foot, so cycling became a big part of his regime.' He adds: 'Of course there were rows, especially when he was on the low-calorie diet. He'd enjoyed food in the past, but it was the wrong food and here we were telling him it was no good for him, and he had to cook dishes from scratch. 'It's a fine balance taking on an almost parental role with your own dad. We had to be encouraging, but firm, without him feeling he was being bullied into anything.' That's where the filming proved so useful. Anthony explains: 'Filming the whole process meant we could show him footage from a couple of weeks before as a motivator so he could see how far he'd come.' In February last year, the sons took their father on a ten-day cycling trip to Spain. Geoff also tried out a sky-dive simulator (he's planning to do one for real later this year), and tackled rock-climbing. 'He'd spent almost four decades doing soul-destroying night shifts, eating large amounts of processed food and doing no exercise. 'We wanted to inspire him, to show him how great life could be,' Anthony says. 'While the weight loss is fantastic, what is really amazing is his new self-confidence , his self-belief and his love of life.' Step three was transforming Geoff into a diabetes champion, so he could convince others to turn their lives around. Now a trimmer 14 stone, Geoff has taken part in the Prudential 100-mile cycle race, spoken at medical conferences throughout Europe and stopped his diabetes in its tracks. At the most recent meeting with his consultant, he was told he is diabetes-free. Geoff believes the doctors had been 'too nice for too long', and wishes they had been tougher on him. 'I'm just so cross I lived for so long with such a bad quality of life, depressed and basically killing myself. Hopefully my transformation can inspire others too.' Fixing Geoff's diabetes has brought the family closer, says Anthony. 'We went to Scotland over Christmas and Dad was out walking with the grandchildren, which would have been almost impossible two years ago. The kids love having a grandad who is active, and we've got our old dad back.' For more information, go to diabetes.co.uk.

{"article":"A mother-of-two who lost her eye to skin cancer is warning people against the dangers of wearing cheap sunglasses. Deborah Kane, from Tyldesley, Manchester, had her right eye removed three years ago in a life-saving nine-hour operation to stop the cancer spreading to her brain. The 46-year-old teaching assistant believes her cancer developed from getting badly burned on holiday in Lanzarote when she was 15 - where she also bought cheap sunglasses without proper UV protection. Scroll down for video . Deborah Kane, from  Manchester (pictured), had her right eye removed three years ago in a life-saving nine-hour operation to stop her skin cancer spreading to her brain . Debbie, pictured with her radiation mask, said, 'They drilled in through the back of my head to get to my eye, so it was a horrible experience' Debbie, who recently filmed a segment about her ordeal for an upcoming TV show called \u2018Fake Britain\u2019, says: 'I want to warn other women of the dangers of buying cheap sunglasses. The decision cost me my eye. 'But I know I\u2019ve been lucky, because through losing my eye, my life was saved.' To celebrate her recovery, Debbie held an aptly named \u2018Eye Ball\u2019 and named each table after a part of the eye. She hopes to repeat the event annually and has so far raised over \u00a310,000 for The Royal Manchester Eye Hospital where she was treated. Debbie\u2019s problems first began when she was 24 and had a cancerous mole removed from her neck. She was given the all-clear and put it behind her. Debbie went on to have two children, Annabel, now 14, and Charlie, eight. 'Having one eye doesn\u2019t stop me at all and I\u2019ve learned to be comfortable with the way I look,' says Debbie, pictured with her niece . But in December 2011, aged 42, she began to suffer with blurred vision. She was eventually diagnosed with a malignant melanoma behind her right eye. Debbie says: 'My mind immediately went back to a teenage holiday in Lanzarote when I had been badly sunburned. I had blistered very badly on my neck, which was exactly the same place where I\u2019d first had skin cancer. 'I had scrimped on sunglasses too; I bought cheap ones because they were trendy \u2013 but they didn\u2019t protect my eyes at all. 'I used to buy lots of them every time I went on holiday because they only cost a couple of euros. I binned them all as soon as I was diagnosed with cancer. She is now cancer free but has to stay out of the sun, and wears a patch over her eye, as she's never felt comfortable with a prosthetic eye. Pictured, Debbie with her doctors . 'My consultant confirmed that the sun was definitely the cause and that the holiday was likely the starting point for cancer. 'I was so angry, so frustrated with myself. But it was too late for that. 'The lump was so big it was forcing the eye up and out of the socket.' Her eye had to be removed, to stop the cancer spreading to her brain, but her consultant had never done that type of surgery before. Debbie says: 'It was a huge risk and he discussed with experts from around the UK before my operation. In the end there were three consultants at my surgery. 'They drilled in through the back of my head to get to my eye, so it was a horrible experience.' In 2012, Debbie had nine hours of gruelling surgery followed by months of radiotherapy. But a year on, she made a good recovery and returned to work. In 2013, she found a cancerous lump in her leg, which also had to be removed. Her consultant believes that Debbie\u2019s eye and leg tumours were both caused by rogue cells from the original tumour in her neck. To celebrate her recovery, Debbie held an aptly named \u2018Eye Ball\u2019 (pictured) and named each table after a part of the eye . She hopes to repeat the event annually and has so far raised over \u00a310,000 for The Royal Manchester Eye Hospital where she was treated . She is now cancer-free but has to stay out of the sun, and wears a patch over her eye, as she's never felt comfortable with a prosthetic eye. Speaking about her Eye Ball, she says: 'My friend didn\u2019t understand the concept and she told me she didn\u2019t want to sit on \"Len\u2019s table\" because she might not like him!' Debbie says: 'Having one eye doesn\u2019t stop me at all and I\u2019ve learned to be comfortable with the way I look. I work as a teacher, I drive a car and do everything like a normal mum. 'The way I see it, losing my eye saved my life. I just hope my story can save someone else.'","highlights":"Deborah Kane, from Manchester, had a melanoma behind her eye .\nDoctors think it may have been a result of wearing cheap sunglasses .\nShe has also had two cancerous lumps removed from neck and leg .\nMother-of-two was badly burned in Lanzarote at the age of 15 .","id":"9af9103417290e43504cddd2176654596b2138da"}
{"article":"It's all Pep Guardiola's fault; him and the good folk of Scotland or, at least, St Andrews. It is a simplification, of course, but perhaps a useful way of understanding why, as we survey the Champions League quarter finals, there are no Premier League clubs troubling the scorers. Bayern Munich take on Porto on Wednesday night and even though they are contending with an injury crisis which leaves them without Bastian Schweinsteiger, Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben among others you might anticipate a sixth Champions League semi-final for Guardiola in his six years of management. Of course Guardiola isn't alone responsible for the decline of the Premier League in Europe; nor is it really down to St Andrews, though the iconic town with its genteel ambience played its part in continental Europe overhauling the English clubs. Pep Guardiola prepares his side for their Champions League quarter-final first leg against Porto . The Bayern boss gives instructions to his goalkeeper Manuel Neuer at a training session on Tuesday . Something happened back in 2008 when Guardiola took over at Barcelona and it wasn't that the Barcelona team changed. Frank Rijkaard had virtually the same players but Guardiola managed to find an extra 25 per cent of performance in them. What happened was a tactical change which had at its roots in St Andrews, where the Barcelona team spent their first pre season under Guardiola. There Messi was a distracted individual, sometimes sneering at Guardiola's insistence on organisation and pressing, according to Guillem Balague's account in his biographies of Messi and Guardiola. But a breakthrough came when Guardiola stuck up for Messi in his battle with the club to play for Argentina in the Beijing Olympics. The new manager took the young Argentinian under his wing, sidling up to him after training, putting his arm round him to assure him of his support. Guardiola is bidding to reach his sixth Champions League semi-final in his six years as a manager . Guardiola got Messi on side in 2008 after standing up for him in battle to represent Argentina at the Beijing Olympics . Messi, the precocious star, suddenly felt he had an ally in Guardiola. And, as a result, he began to buy into Guardiola's idea of relentless pressing to supplement the tiki taka football, which was already a template at Barcelona. For tiki taka is not what made Guardiola\u2019s team great. 'I loathe all that passing for the sake of it, all that tiki-taka. It's rubbish and has no purpose.' It sounds like Sam Allardyce, but those are the words of the great high priest of possession football as reported by Marti Perarnau in his book Pep Confidential. What Guardiola added to Barcelona\u2019s game was the intensity, drive and sheer energy which had wilted under Rijkaard and then moulded it with overwhelming possession. Sometimes, when assessing the English problem in Europe, it helps to reverse the question. So, rather than ask 'Why are we so bad now?' it useful to identify why were we so good between 2005-2009?' Guardiola led Barcelona to Champions League glory in 2009 and 2011 (pictured) The former Barcelona manager is thrown into the air by his players as they celebrate the 2011 success . For Chelsea fans pointing to the 2012 triumph, that it was indeed a victory of rare courage amidst adversity but the decline of English clubs had already begun and that win is effectively an outlier, bucking the established trend. Between 2005-2009 the Premier League provided 12 out of the potential 20 semi finalists for the Champions League; between 2010 to 2015 it has provided three out of 24. Even asking that question is revealing as what English clubs were really good at during that period was making the semi finals and the final rather than winning the trophy. Only Liverpool and Manchester United actually achieved that in the five-year period of English ascendancy, though, of course, Chelsea did so improbably in 2012. What was different about English clubs in that period was the injection of some of the finest tactical minds in the game to the Premier League. Jose Mourinho may never have won the trophy with Chelsea but he transformed their approach and arguably provided the foundations for the 2008 final and the remarkable 2012 win. Rafael Benitez was an extraordinary force, the Diego Simeone of that era, regularly out-witting Mourinho and taking a relatively normal Liverpool team to two finals. Guus Hiddink engineered a fine run to the semi finals building on the work of Mourinho. Manchester United won the Champions League in 2008 when English clubs were dominating the latter stages . Chelsea were an exception to the rule in 2012 when they won the tournament against all the odds . Rising to the challenge of Mourinho and Benitez, Sir Alex Ferguson was tactically at his peak in that period, playing without a recognised centre foward at times in 2008 before Guardiola and others made it fashionable. English teams had always had an intensity with which continental teams had sometimes struggled to cope. What they had lacked often was organisation and tactical nous. Benitez, Mourinho, Hiddink provided that and Ferguson responded. Put all that together and you have a cultural melting pot which, allied to the commercial success of the Premier League, was pushing players and teams to new heights. The Premier League\u2019s TV money of course brought in good, technical foreign players which helped but that does not seem to be the key reason for its success. The money is bigger now and those players still come but it hasn't helped Manchester City. At the zenith of the Premier League's dominance, the 2008 Moscow final, ten English players started the game. Manchester City were eliminated in the last 16 this season at the hands of Barcelona . Chelsea exited at the same stage as England have no representatives in the quarter-finals . When Jurgen Klinsmann spoke about the tactical revolution he was attempting to forge in Germany in 2006 - a style of play which has since evolved at Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich - he explicitly referenced the Premier League and its pace. He recognised that continental Europe had fallen behind. It was new tactical ideas meeting the traditional attributes of the English game which helped the Premier League dominate Europe. Conversely, it was Guardiola - and others, such as Jurgen Klopp, Louis van Gaal, Jupp Heynckes - surpassing that intensity which in turn overhauled the Premier League. Clubs such as Barca, Bayern, Dortmund have retained their technical superiority over English clubs but they are now likely to out-run them and out-press them. In reality there is no one man responsible for that change. And, Guardiola's obsession with pressing is rooted in an admiration for South American football and especially Marcelo Bielsa, rather than the Premier League. But when that change took place, the Premier League lost its competitive edge. And when Guardiola put his arm around Messi at St Andrews back in the summer of 2008 and convinced his young protege to buy into that pressing game, European football changed forever.","highlights":"Bayern Munich take on Porto in the Champions League quarter-final .\nPep Guardiola bidding to reach sixth semi-final in sixth year as a manager .\nFrom 2005-2009 England had 12 out of 20 Champions League semi-finalists .\nIn last five years only three semi-finalists have been from Premier League .\nGuardiola changed Barcelona tactically, introducing relentless pressing .\nLionel Messi brought into it when Guardiola supported him against the club .\nPremier League clubs have struggled to cope with that intensity in Europe .","id":"5a3d3b7a4ae2c36d206bfc289e43b8ec6cec1223"}
{"article":"The life of a 16-year-old girl stabbed to death at a Connecticut school a year ago on the day of prom was celebrated Saturday by hundreds of people with a road race, fried food and live music. Wearing shirts in Maren Sanchez's favorite color of purple, the crowd filled a baseball field behind Milford's Jonathan Law High School, where she was attacked and killed in a hallway on April 25, 2014. A classmate, Christopher Plaskon, has been charged with murder. After a week of somber remembrances at the school, her classmates and event organizers said the idea was to remember Sanchez on the anniversary of her death as she would have wanted, with smiles and joy. Remembrance: Friends embrace and remember slain student Maren Sanchez on Saturday, April 25, 2015 . Plans: Maren Sanchez, pictured in the dress she had planned to wear to prom, was excited about the dance which was due to attend with her new boyfriend last year . 'I did it':\u00a0Chris Plaskon is being charged with murder as an adult over the stabbing of Sanchez . 'I don't think there's anything sad about this,' said Darby Hudd, a 17-year-old friend of the slain teen. 'It's such a celebration.' The slaying stunned people around Connecticut and especially in this shoreline city, where Sanchez is remembered as an outgoing person, active in drama and other school activities, who had a kind word for anyone she met. The event included a kickball tournament, bounce houses and a dunk tank, with proceeds benefiting a scholarship program created by Sanchez's mother. The day was bittersweet, with some exchanging long hugs, but organizers said they agreed with Sanchez's mother, Donna Cimarelli, that the community did not need another vigil. 'We've cried a lot in this town. If you knew Maren, she would have embraced an event like this,' said Elena Garet, whose daughter was friends with the teenager.

The classmate accused of attacking Sanchez with a knife, Christopher Plaskon, has pleaded not guilty. His attorney has said he intends to use an insanity defense. Police have said they were looking into whether the attack was related to Sanchez's refusal to be Plaskon's date to their junior prom. Fran Thompson, the high school principal, said students and faculty are still recovering from the loss of the beloved girl. Over the last week, he said, the school held memorial events and students have been tweeting favorite memories of Sanchez and examples of people showing kindness toward others.

{"article":"A thief nicknamed the 'Black Widow of Facebook' \u00a0who drugged and robbed men after she lured them into bed has been arrested. Argentinian con-artist Sofia Davila posted raunchy pictures or herself online and then flirted with unsuspecting men she had contacted on the social network, suggesting they meet up for sex. But after meeting her victims, the 21-year-old from Buenos Aires, would spike their drinks and wait for them to fall unconscious, before ransacking their homes. Buenos Aires thief Sofia Davila, 21, would start chatting to men over Facebook before suggesting that they meet up. When they did, she would spike their drinks and rob their homes after they fell unconscious . The 21-year-old posted raunchy pictures of herself on Facebook and flirt with strangers she added on the network. She was caught after trying to trick police that she was an innocent bystanders in the robberies . Diego Escalante, from Tigre, Buenos Aires, said he had been robbed after falling victim to the ploy. The 39-year-old said: 'We had been flirting with each other for about two weeks and then she suggested we get together. 'We went to a hotel and had a good time and when she suggested we meet again I didn't think anything was suspicious. 'The next time we met she came to my place and said she'd like to drink her own alcohol and poured me one too. I then began to fill ill and passed out. 'When I woke up my feet and hands were tied and there were two men in my flat taking my TV, stereo and other things.' After carrying out the ruse Davila went to the police station herself to report the robbery - claiming she had been forced to leave the flat by the men, and had been powerless to stop them. The thief has been nicknamed the 'Black Widow of Facebook'. She is now awaiting trial after admitting tricking 15 men and robbing them. Two of her accomplices will also appear in court over the crimes . But a spokesman for the police said they were suspicious, having received numerous calls from men who had been stolen from after they spent the night with a woman they met over the internet . He said: 'The problem with her statement was that we had already received a dozen complaints from other men saying they had been robbed after meeting a woman over Facebook. 'This was the first time the woman had actually shown up herself though, but because she matched the description we already had we decided to hold her for questioning. One of Davila's victims said the pair hit it off at a hotel, and he didn't think have any suspicions when they met up again at his home. He said she drugged him and he woke up with his feet tied and two men stealing his TV . 'As soon as we spoke to the victim we knew she was the woman behind the robberies and it only took a little while before we had a full confession. We also found that the man had been drugged.' Davila admitted to bedding and robbing more than 15 men and is now awaiting trial along with her two accomplices. Argentinian news website DiarioVeloz.com\u00a0said Davila, who worked in PR for a bowling alley, told police she was forced to commit the crimes to pay off her debts to a drug dealer .","highlights":"Sofia Davila, 21, nicknamed the 'Black Widow of Facebook' over crimes .\nCaught after going to police, claiming she was forced out her victim's flat .\nShe has admitted bedding and robbing 15 men after spiking their drinks .","id":"f626c6096993940a7e4b124f6ccca0ae984ecdda"}

The 22-year-old's\u00a0Kode With Karlie scholarships will provide 20 girls between the ages of 13 and 18 free tuition to the same two-week coding course she took last year at the\u00a0Flatiron Pre-College Academy. 'Code is only going to continue to play a major role in defining our future,' she says in a video promoting Kode With Karlie.\u00a0'I think it's crucial that young women learn to code as early as possible to ensure that we [...] have a voice and a stake in what the world looks like.' Scroll down for video . Role model: Karlie Kloss can be seen flexing her muscles in a promotional video for her Kode With Karlie scholarship program, which will provide 20 young girls free tuition for a computer coding course this summer . Team player: The 22-year-old model was filmed working with other students at the\u00a0Flatiron School in New York, where her scholarship recipients will be taking a two week\u00a0software engineering program . Karlie is donating $20,000 of her own money for the classes, which cost $2,000 per student, while the Flatiron school has offered to match her contribution. The blonde beauty, who describes herself as a 'model, ballerina and cookie expert' in the clip, explains that she learned how 'creative coding truly is' when she studied it last summer. 'Similar to dance and fashion, coding is a form of self-expression,' she says. 'It's a way to turn a cool, innovative idea into a product, website, app, tool or experience.' Karlie says it was this revelation that inspired her to share her passion with other girls across the country. Major revelation: Karlie attended the coding course, which costs $2,000 per student, last year . Deep in thought: The former Victoria's Secret Angel can be seen working on a computer programming project with other students . Completed project: Karlie and other students watched their hard work pay off as their creation took flight . After the course, her 20 scholarship recipients will understand the 'building blocks of coding' and have already built and deployed their own app to the web. In order to apply for the scholarship, female students are asked to film a 60 second video explaining how they plan to use their 'coding super powers' after they complete the course. Karlie took to social media yesterday to promote the opportunity, tweeting: 'Who runs the world? CODERS! Apply for the #KodeWithKarlie Scholarship @FlatironSchool for your chance to learn code! [sic]' And it's clear that Karlie, who also co-founded Karlie\u2019s Kookies with chef and owner of Milk Bar Christina Tosi, takes her entrepreneurial roles and studies seriously. Stellar student: Karlie can be seen working with other students at the software engineering class last summer . Combined interests: The blonde beauty can be seen speaking on a panel about how technology revolutionized fashion week at SXSW in Austin, Texas . In February, it was announced that she was hanging up her Angel wings and leaving Victoria's Secret to focus on other business opportunities, as well as her classes at New York University. The model will be starting college at NYU's Gallatin School of Individualized Study in the fall, where she will study computer coding. Karlie, who covered the summer issue of Porter, told the magazine that she 'definitely could not get a job as a coder yet'. American girl: Karlie, who covers the summer issue of Porter, told the magazine she is 'fascinated' by computer coding . Catwalk queen: Karlie can be seen strutting down the runway at the Tom Ford show (L) and the\u00a0Atelier Versace haute couture show (R) earlier this year . 'But it is something I am fascinated by, even if it is not the profession I choose,' she added. Karlie continued: 'Simply having the comprehension of the way that it works, having the ability to speak that language and to be able to not only comprehend it, but write and build something \u2013 the world is built on code.' And Karlie has no problem blending her two worlds together. Last month, she spoke on a panel about how technology revolutionized fashion week at SXSW in Austin, Texas.","highlights":"The 22-year-old teamed up with the Flatiron School in New York to offer 20 girls free tuition to a two-week software engineering program .\nKarlie attended the course last year and was inspired to share her experience with young girls across the country .\nThe model gave $20,000 of her own money to create the scholarship, with the Flatiron School matching her donation .","id":"7149bfe70d4e5ddcb92b0687e713f568f6f74764"}
{"article":"After two months and more than 100 witnesses, the prosecution has rested in the murder trial of former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez. The 25-year-old has pleaded not guilty to shooting  Odin Lloyd five times in the chest and back. Lloyd, who was dating his fiancee's sister, was found dead in an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez's home on June 17, 2013. Prosecutors have presented hundreds of pieces of evidence since testimony began on January 29, including surveillance videos from inside\u00a0Hernandez's home that showed him holding a black object that appeared to be a gun less than 10 minutes after Lloyd's killing. Scroll down for video . Trial: The jury has rested in the murder trial of former New England Patriots football player Aaron Hernandez after two months and more than 100 witnesses that featured in the prosecution's case against him . William Zane, of the state medical examiner's office, points to a mannequin while testifying about the location of bullet wounds in the body of Odin Lloyd  during the murder trial of former New England Patriots tight end . A joint found near Lloyd's body had DNA from both men on it. And the shell of a bullet matching the one that killed Lloyd was found on the floor of Hernandez's car - stuck to a piece of gum that matched the former Patriot tight end's DNA. On the final day of testimony, the prosecution heard from William Zane, of the state medical examiner's office, who used a mannequin to point to where Odin Lloyd was allegedly shot - in the chest and in the back. The defense team, in contrast, is not expected to take long hitting back. Jurors could be sent to deliberate\u00a0as early as next week. At the time of the alleged murder, Hernandez had a $40 million contract with the Patriots. Hernandez's legal team has contested the legitimacy of the evidence, calling into question the testimony of an employee of weapons manufacturer Glock who had identified the black object as a gun and arguing instead that it was a piece of electronics such as an iPad or a TV remote. They also have gone after the police investigation, painting it as bumbling and inept and saying Hernandez was targeted as a suspect because he is a celebrity. Decision: The defense team is expected to wrap up quickly next week before the jury delivers a verdict . Prosecutor William McCauley announced on Thursday that the prosecution had rested. Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh then sent the jurors home. Garsh is expected to hear arguments Friday on several pending issues. Hernandez's lawyer James Sultan told Garsh this week that the defense team expects to call witnesses Monday and be completed with their questioning that day. Once the defense rests, each side will deliver a closing argument. Then the jury will be given instructions, and three alternates will be randomly selected from among the 15 jurors immediately before deliberating. A final jury of 12 members will decide Hernandez's fate. Eighteen jurors began the trial in January, but three were dismissed, including one who is accused of misrepresenting her answers during screening in a bid to get onto the jury.","highlights":"Prosecutors have called more than 100 witnesses to testify .\nDefense team expected to wrap up within a day or two .\nThe 15 jurors could be sent out early next week to deliberate .\nHernandez has pleaded not guilty to shooting dead Odin Lloyd .","id":"e8b93366b9c9c5bf4409dc1f8064122063ccd4ca"}
{"article":"Comcast is abandoning its bid to buy Time Warner Cable for $45.2billion and  create a mega-size TV and internet provider, it was reported today. The move comes after Federal Communications Commission decided that merger wasn't in the public interest and threw up a regulatory roadblock following fierce opposition from net neutrality activists and content providers like Disney and 21st Century Fox. Bloomberg, followed by the New York Times, reported Thursday afternoon\u00a0that Comcast is planning to 'walk away' from the deal rather than fight it out with the federal government. An announcement from the telecoms giant, already the biggest cable company in the country, could come as early as tomorrow.\u00a0Comcast and Time Warner Cable declined to comment on Thursday. Scroll down for video . Ding-dong: Experts, including Columbia University professor Tim Wu, declared the Comcast-Time Warner Cable murder dead after the FCC expressed skepticism . Mega-merger: The $45.2billion deal would have merged Comcast's 30million customers with Time Warner Cable's 11million. The new company would have spun off or sold 3.9million customers . The proposed merger would have controlled 57percent of the broadband internet market and 30 percent of the paid TV market with more than 27million customers across the nation. On Wednesday night, the\u00a0Wall Street Journal revealed that Federal Communications Commission regulators questioned whether the creation of mega-size TV and internet provider was in the public interest. Staffers reportedly planned to recommend that an administrative law judge review the deal - a regulatory obstacle that is likely to cost both companies several months of hearings and many millions of dollars. The hearings were likely to draw the companies past the merger deadline, at the very least. Columbia University professor and net neutrality activist Tim Wu tweeted: 'Comcast merger is dead.' CNN's Brian Stelter reports that some inside the companies were talking about the deal in the past tense almost immediately after the FCC decision. Combining the No. 1 and No. 2 U.S. cable companies would put nearly 30 percent of TV and about 55 percent of broadband subscribers under one roof. That would give the resulting behemoth unprecedented power over what Americans watch and download. That has had competitors, consumer groups, and Senators lining up to oppose the deal. Time Warner Cable's shares dipped slightly in trading on Thursday - though Comcast stocks were actually up after the news . 'This is one of those deals where the opponents of the merger have been one of the most vocal I can remember,' said S&P Capital IQ Tuna Amobi. One concern, for example, is that the company could undermine the streaming video industry by requiring onerous payments from new online-only video providers for connecting to its network. Dish, the satellite TV company behind the new Web video service Sling TV, and Netflix are opposed to the deal. Another charge is that Comcast hasn't stuck to conditions imposed on it when it bought NBCUniversal. The company says it has, except for one circumstance when the FCC found it wasn't promoting a stand-alone Internet service. Comcast says it fixed that. Pushback against the merger has picked up in the last couple weeks. Al Franken, D-Minn., along with five other Democratic senators and Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, this week urged the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice to block the merger, saying it would lead to higher prices and fewer choices. Recent media reports suggested that regulators aren't going to approve it. On Friday, Bloomberg, citing unidentified people, said Department of Justice staff attorneys were leaning against the deal. The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday said, also citing unidentified people, said that FCC staff recommended that the merger review go to a hearing under an administrative law judge, although no final decision had been made. The FCC would send the deal to a judge if it didn't believe it serves the public interest. The company has the right to present its case to the judge. But a trial could take months and even then a decision could be appealed to the FCC. 'It's a dead end for Comcast,' said Rob McDowell, a former FCC commissioner. The Justice Department declined to comment. The FCC declined to comment and spokesman Neil Grace said the review is ongoing. Comcast spokeswoman Sena Fitzmaurice confirmed that company executives met Wednesday with Justice Department and FCC officials. But she would not comment on what occurred during the meetings or what other conversations the company is having with regulators. If the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal falls through, a transaction with Charter Communications Inc. aimed to smoothing the way for regulatory approval also falls apart. Charter's bid for Bright House Networks, which it announced in March, could also be killed. Many analysts expect that Charter, which lost out on its bid for Time Warner Cable to Comcast, to resurrect its effort if Comcast is rebuffed. 'Other cable deals that don't involve Comcast might be allowed to go through,' McDowell said. There 'seems to be an antipathy towards Comcast at the FCC' because the agency thinks Comcast didn't stick to the conditions of the NBCUniversal merger, he said. A combined Charter and Time Warner Cable would have 15 million video customers and 16.5 million Internet customers. That's still smaller than Comcast alone, which has 22.4 million video subscribers and 22 million Internet customers. Comcast wanted Time Warner Cable to bulk up on subscribers as it deals with old rivals Dish, DirecTV and Verizon's FiOS, as well as newer, cheaper online competitors like Netflix. The company had also said the deal would help it cut costs, including for programming \u2014 the shows and movies it pipes to subscribers. But Comcast may have to look overseas for future acquisitions. 'Washington's concern here is excessive control of broadband in the hands of a single company,' wrote analyst Craig Moffett in a client email. 'For all intents and purposes, their M&A ambitions would be on ice in the U.S.' Read more: http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/wires\/ap\/article-3052969\/Reports-say-Comcast-plans-drop-45B-Time-Warner-Cable-bid.html#ixzz3YAkxSfYl Follow us: @MailOnline on Twitter | DailyMail on Facebook .","highlights":"Merger would have given the new company control of 57percent of the broadband internet market and 30percent of the paid TV market .\nAnnouncement that Comcast is 'walking away' from deal could come Friday .\nComcast has 30million subscribers and Time Warner Cable boasts 11million; new company would have spun off or sold 3.9million .\nFCC staffers recommended the merger be sent to a judge for review - a significant regulatory hurdle .\nRegulators questions whether merger was in the public interest .","id":"8ba5777dc7f6b5939f709a77f91fef2cda9e07d4"}
{"article":"A woman stabbed her boyfriend through the heart after he arrived home to find her in a short dress and stockings about to have sex with her lover, a court heard. Natasha Elderfield, 41, chased her partner off the boat they shared after he discovered her below deck with her lover, whose trousers were around his ankles, a jury was told yesterday. The court heard how she flew into a rage when boyfriend Robert Dobinson interrupted her attempts to have sex with another man. Natasha Elderfield, 41, is on trial at Oxford Crown Court accused of the murder of her boyfriend Robert Dobinson, 33, in Abingdon, Oxfordshire . She told police officers who arrested her, \u2018my God, it\u2019s so ******g funny\u2019, after stabbing Mr Dobinson and leaving him to die on the banks of the Thames, the jury was told. Mr Dobinson, 33, had been dating mother-of-two Elderfield for about two years. The couple had had sex in the morning of the day he was killed, the court heard. The court heard that Elderfield\u2019s lover, Tony Steggles, had brought a large amount of alcohol to the boat, and a \u2018sulky\u2019 Mr Dobinson had left to spend the afternoon with a friend. As Elderfield and Mr Steggles spent the afternoon drinking and dancing, Mr Dobinson repeatedly called his girlfriend in a jealous rage \u2013 with his constant interruptions making her more and more infuriated. At one point, she became so enraged that she called the police, telling the 999 operator \u2018he\u2019s had his ******g due, I\u2019m not having this any more\u2019. The court heard how, within ten minutes of that phone call, blood-soaked Mr Dobinson was staggering desperately along the bank of the river, yelling \u2018help me, I\u2019ve been stabbed\u2019. Describing the afternoon the two lovers spent on the boat, prosecutor Charles Ward-Jackson told the court: \u2018Natasha Elderfield had on a short dress and for a while she also had on stockings and they were getting affectionate and were on the point of having sexual contact. \u2018She had spent a very pleasurable evening with her new lover Mr Steggles \u2013 drinking, dancing, the promise of sex \u2013 and it was being interrupted by her very irritating ex-partner and she was fed up of it. \u2018That is the background against which Mr Dobinson arrived.\u2019 After storming back to the boat, moored where the couple lived in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, Mr Dobinson went below deck to find his girlfriend and her lover in a tryst. The scene of the alleged murder on the banks of the River Thames in Abingdon, Oxfordshire . Mr Ward-Jackson told the jury: \u2018It is likely that Mr Dobinson knew or suspected about this affair and not surprisingly resented it. \u2018Within a short space of time Mr Dobinson arrived on the boat. Natasha Elderfield and Mr Steggles were down in the cabin and were about to have sex. \u2018He had his trousers down when Mr Dobinson came down into the cabin and his arrival must have been extremely unwelcome.\u2019 The court heard a fight broke out, with Elderfield throwing crockery at Mr Dobinson\u2019s head and he in turn hitting her over the head with a fire extinguisher. The jury heard she then chased him out of the cabin armed with a 4.5in kitchen knife and stabbed him through the heart. \u2018She returned to the boat, still holding the knife in an overhand grip, and told Mr Steggles: \u2018I\u2019ve stabbed the bastard.\u2019 Elderfield, who told police that Mr Dobinson had accidentally walked on to the knife during a heated argument, denies murder. The trial continues. Police cordoned off a large section of the river bank after Mr Dobinson was found with fatal stab wounds .

Simon Wood, 38, battled it out against Emma Spitzer and Tony Rodd as they were challenged to cook judges John Torode and Gregg Wallace a three-course meal in three hours. The final followed seven weeks of tough challenges, including the 'chef's table', which involved cooking one of three courses on a menu set up by Italian chef Massimo Bottura. It brings to an end the eleventh series of the popular BBC weekly amateur cooking contest. Mr Wood, a data manager from Oldham in Greater Manchester, served a starter of octopus with chorizo and cannellini beans followed by a main of squab pigeon served two ways with blackberry sauce, watercress puree and carrots. He finished with a dessert of lemon posset topped with seven garnishes \u2013 citrus tutti-frutti, charred grapefruit and orange, a lime tuile, limoncello pistachio crumb, edible flowers, tarragon leaves and a lime air. After he presented the dishes to the judges, Torode said: 'Do you know why I love you? Because you take something quite ordinary and make it special.' Wallace said: 'Simon is brilliant, he's an incredible talent.' After being crowned the winner, Mr Wood said: 'I'm shaking inside, it's so surreal, I can't begin to describe how happy I am.

{"article":"Yemeni rebels have seized President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi's palace on the same day Al-Qaeda militants freed hundreds of inmates in a jailbreak. Security officials said member of Al-Qaeda stormed a Hadramawt provincial prison in southeast Yemen and freed more than 300 inmates, including one of their leaders Khalid Batarfi. Batarfi is among Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's  top regional commanders, known for his leading role in a 2011-2012 battle with government troops during which extremists seized large parts of the south and east. Rebels: Armed Houthi members raise their guns aloft while shouting anti-Saudi slogans during a rally protesting airstrikes carried out by a Saudi-led coalition, yesterday . Two guards and five inmates were killed in clashes, the official said. Elsewhere, the advance by Iran-backed rebels into Aden, the last bastion of Hadi supporters came despite a week of Saudi-led air strikes. A senior security official who witnessed the advance said: 'Dozens of Houthi militia and their allies arrived in armoured troop carriers and entered Al-Maashiq presidential palace'. Heavy clashes erupted afterwards between the rebels and their opponents inside the compound. A defence ministry official in Aden later confirmed the fall of the palace, saying it was now controlled by forces loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, which have allied with the Huthis. Escalating: Damage caused by reported Saudi-airstrikes. Reports today say Yemeni rebels have seized President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi's palace . War-zone:\u00a0Yemenis walk around the damage caused by an airstrike allegedly carried out by a Saudi-led coalition against a Houthi rebels position in the city of Yarim . The rebels have seized swathes of the country including the capital Sanaa. At least 44 people, including 18 civilians, were reported dead  in fierce fighting between opponents and supporters of Hadi in the southern port city today. 'There are bodies and wounded in the streets and nobody dares to approach,' said Khaled al-Shaie, a resident in the central neighbourhood of Crater. Hadi fled to Aden from the capital after the Huthi Shiite rebels seized power in February, and the palace came under fire from warplanes twice during his stay. Carnage:\u00a0A Yemeni man inspects his house damaged by an airstrike allegedly carried out by a Saudi-led coalition, yesterday. Today, rebel forces seized\u00a0President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi's palace . He went into hiding last week as the rebels bore down on what was his last stronghold, later surfacing in the Saudi capital as Riyadh launched an air war on the rebels. Saudi Arabia announced Thursday its first casualties since launching the offensive, with one soldier killed and 10 more wounded by gunfire from across the Yemeni border. Rights groups have expressed alarm at civilian casualties, including in an air strike on a camp for displaced people and the bombing of a dairy. Several dozen people were killed in both incidents. \"All sides in Yemen's conflict need to do what they can to avoid harming civilians,\" said Joe Stork of New York-based Human Rights Watch. In the southern province of Dhaleh, Huthis killed 40 rebel fighters who tried to desert after their commander urged them to lay down their arms because of the intense air strikes, military sources said. Diplomats in New York said Gulf countries were locked in tough negotiations with Russia on a UN draft resolution to impose an arms embargo and sanctions on the rebels.","highlights":"300 inmates including Al-Qaeda leader freed during breakout at jail .\nTwo guards and five inmates killed in clashes .\n44 people, including 18 civilians, reportedly killed in city of Aden .\nSecurity officials later confirmed fall of the palace .","id":"330b37abb72e3a643949136ab02103355acecb38"}

Of the most popular players investigated, Liverpool striker Balotelli received by the far the most with more than 8,000 discriminatory messages directed at him and Arsenal's Danny Welbeck faced 1,700. In each case, at least 50 per cent of the abuse was racist. Meanwhile Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge received 1,600, more than 60 per cent of which related to sexual orientation. The clubs facing the most abuse reflected the top five in the league \u2014 albeit in a different order \u2014 Chelsea receiving 20,000, Liverpool 19,000, Arsenal 12,000 and Manchester United and City both getting 11,000. Almost a third of the abusive posts were racist, a quarter were based on gender and just under a fifth about sexual orientation. A further 11 per cent were about disability, nine per cent anti-semitism, five per cent islamophobia, two per cent about age and one per cent regarding gender reassignment.

The city that generated the highest volume of discriminatory posts by far was London, with 26,433 recorded during this campaign. Manchester is second with 8,331 and Liverpool follow with 6,792. Each of those are places with large populations which are home to successful clubs. Social media, in particular Twitter, has been a constant problem for football clubs since it grew in popularity, with Premier League stars and clubs having millions of followers. Manchester United tried to ban Twitter among their players in 2010 to little success. Former Liverpool player Ryan Babel was the first professional player to face action for a post online when he accepted a Football Association charge of improper conduct and was fined \u00a310,000 for criticising referee Howard Webb on Twitter in 2011. Last year, Rio Ferdinand was suspended for three matches and fined \u00a325,000 by the governing body when he included the word 'sket' \u2014 slang for a promiscuous woman or girl \u2014 in a reply to a tweet mocking him. Rio Ferdinand was suspended for three matches and fined \u00a325,000 for a tweet include the word 'sket' In January this year, Stoke defender Robert Huth was handed a \u00a315,000 fine and banned for two games for replying to a Twitter account which posts sexual images of individuals and asks users to guess their gender. Balotelli was fined \u00a325,000 and banned for one match for a controversial image he posted on Instagram. Yet it appears the growing problem is in social media's use for attacking clubs and players which is spiralling out of control.

{"article":"An eight-year-old boy was taken to hospital after falling victim to a prank when he was suffocated until he passed out. Police in Manchester have now issued a warning to parents over the game, known as 'sleeper', which officers say is potentially fatal. The child's details have not been release but a Greater Manchester Police spokesman said the child is believed to have had underlying health problems and is expected to make a full recovery. Officers from Greater Manchester Police have been forced to issue a warning on Facebook (pictured) after an eight-year-old boy was hospitalised after a playground suffocation prank called 'sleeper' went wrong . The 'sleeper' prank involves a child having their nose and mouth held shut by another child\u00a0until they black out from lack of oxygen. The youngster was treated in hospital on Wednesday after they were a\u00a0'sleeper' victim, police said. Officers in North Manchester believe it is a new craze and have alerted\u00a0parents. GMP's North Manchester division posted on their Facebook site after the\u00a0incident: 'Dangerous New Craze Warning - Attention all\u00a0parents\/guardians...We have received reports of a new craze called\u00a0'Sleeper' This involves children completely covering the mouth and noses of\u00a0younger children until they completely pass out. Manchester's city centre chief councillor Pat Karney (pictured) has said the craze must be stopped 'before we have a tragedy on our hands' 'This is extremely dangerous, a child is currently in hospital being\u00a0treated after falling victim to this game. Please advise every child you\u00a0know and warn them of the dangers, this could easily lead to concussion or even death. The post has now been shared more than 11,200 times on the social network. GMP's Facebook post received a flurry of responses from followers, some\u00a0claiming the game dates back several years. Tasha Williams replied: 'This was happening when I was at school although\u00a0it was someone pushing on your chest really hard or on your throat, it is a\u00a0stupid game.' Linzi Walker added: 'It's not new it's been going for years and years.' But Pete James said: 'Only buzz I used to get as a kid was putting a\u00a0crushed carton in the back wheel of my bike and making it sound like a\u00a0motorbike! What's wrong with kids??' Stuart Roberts worte: 'Are the children of today total numbnuts??' Sebastian Ziola added: 'Back in my day, we played Pogs. Oh how times\u00a0change.' A senior council boss in Manchester has issued a stark warning about the craze. Pat Karney, councillor for neighbouring Harpurhey ward, told the Manchester Evening News: 'This news will put the fear of God in any parent or guardian. 'I will be talking to the council officers in the area to see how we can provide more information and warnings to local schools and parents. 'It has to stop before we have a terrible tragedy on our hands. The problem is that when kids hear about an incident like this, it goes viral in an instant in today's world. Officers in Manchester (GMP headquarters pictured) believe 'sleeper' is a new craze and have alerted parents .","highlights":"Eight-year-old boy was hospitalised after being suffocated during 'game'\nIn it child's nose and mouth are held shut by another until they pass out .\nPolice in Manchester are warning that 'sleeper' prank is potentially fatal .\nCouncillor says craze must be stopped before 'we have a terrible tragedy'","id":"1c371f0a20c89ec3ac51405052e37f4c204fe2e8"}
{"article":"Getting thousands of dollars more when you sell your house could be as simple as changing the door-knobs or sprucing up the curtains. Finder.com.au money and real estate expert Michelle Hutchison says there are easy ways to improve the look and feel of your home for prospective buyers - and they need not cost thousands. 'Spending a relatively small amount can go a seriously long way when it comes to the returns you could make on the value of your home,' she told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Get into the garden: Tidying the edges, mowing the lawn and trimming the trees will improve the presentation of your home. This beautiful garden at 115 Jersey Road in Woollahra immediately catches the eye. The house on the market and last sold four years ago for $5.5m . Putting in new lights and light fittings can make a home stand out, just like this home for sale in Sandy Bay in Tasmania. It's expected to fetch upwards of $2.5m . Artwork like these paintings at 1 Madeline Street in Hunters Hill and photo collages, along with new curtains, can add plenty to your home's appearance. It went for $4.5m in 2013 and is on the market . This property at 5 Closeburn Avenue in Prahran stands out with its bright lights. New light fittings and a fresh coat of paint are winners, according to money expert Michelle Hutchison . Michelle Hutchison (right) is a money expert from Finder.com.au who insists that de-cluttering and reworking the wardrobes to look as presentable as those featured on The Block (left) will add cash to your sale . In most parts, the Australian property market remains at record high levels, and the experts say you can profit even more handsomely from a bit of elbow-grease. Ms Hutchison said going to the local hardware store and buying a few tins of paint can make a world of difference in just a few hours. Change the door handles . Paint the walls . Give kitchen cupboards new colour . Clean out the wardrobes . De-clutter the garage . Put in new carpet . Fix up the garden . Put in new curtains . Change the light fittings . Put up photo collages and paintings . 'Presenting your home with a fresh coat of paint, new carpet or even a good tidy can potentially add many thousands of dollars to your home's value,' she said. 'Get tidy and organised, and fix those things that have been broken forever. 'Get your kids involved to occupy them as well as save money by doing it yourself. 'It might be cheaper than going away for the weekend and the best part is that any improvements will almost guarantee you'll add significant value to your home.' Changing the door handles is her first tip. 'Replacing tired, grubby and dated door handles to shiny, matching new ones throughout your home can transform your doors and hallways,' Ms Hutchison said. 'New kitchen cupboard door handles can also give your kitchen a whole new fresh look . 'For as little as $5 and no more than $20 each from your local hardware store, they are inexpensive and an easy do-it-yourself project.' She said that a coat of paint is underestimated as a sell point but the fresh, brighter appearance of a house is very important ahead of a sale. 'Painting a light, fresh neutral colour on your walls can make your whole home much cleaner and brand new. 'If you have wooden kitchen cupboard doors you could also paint them which would give your kitchen a face lift. 'And don't forget to spring clean your cupboards and any areas that are cluttered such as a garage or study.' The doors and handles stand out in this part of 11A Molesworth Street, North Adelaide. Getting rid of marks on doors and frames and even changing door-knobs are encouraged by real estate assessors . A beautiful garden is a must like this which adorns this Woollahra property at 115 Jersey Road . Michelle Hutchison tells vendors to de-clutter clothes storage areas, lay new carpet and put images on the wall like you see at 1 Madeline Street, Hunters HIll . 'Tidying up and organising your storage spaces will always add value to any home, sell old clothes and shoes' she told DMA to make look wardrobes look as good as those on The Block . Finder's real estate assessors say buyers are increasingly on the lookout for places which have great storage space and that's an easy fix, even for the most cluttered of homes. 'Tidying up and organising your storage spaces will always add value to any home,' she insisted. 'Sell old clothes and shoes on sites like eBay or Gumtree or have a garage sale and you could make some money to go towards other fixes around your home. 'This gives the impression of having a bigger property, with families looking for as much storage space as possible.' First appearances are everything in real estate and the garden must be tended to. Interesting artwork and photo collages give homes real character. This 8 Cintra Avenue, St Kilda home has gained plenty of attention ahead of auction . New light fittings and carpet make a big difference and are among the ten top tips to add great value to your sale. This room has all those qualities in the 115 Jersey Road, Woollahra home . Lights, camera, action. Fittings and artwork adorn 27 Oban Street at South Yarra . Create wardrobe and storage space like they do on The Block and it will pay dividends say money experts . 'Spending some time in the garden can do wonders to the appeal of your home,' Ms Hutchison revealed. 'The best part is that it doesn't have to cost anything. 'Pruning plants and weeding and make a home look a million dollars. 'Some councils even provide free mulch which you can spread on your garden beds.' Once you're done on the outside, returning to the interior will serve you well. 'You can update any room with new curtains and best of all you don't have to spend thousands of dollars,' she said. 'Retailers like Kmart and Target sell ready-made curtains that even have block-out backing. 'Make sure you measure your window to ensure the curtain will cover it before buying. 'And change light fittings, just another small cost that can make a big difference to any room. 'Most lighting shops will have stock ready to go so there's no time wasted to order the fittings.' Her last tip is to be inventive about what you place on those newly painted walls, suggesting photo collages are a sure-fire winner. 'This is a great idea to add a personal touch to an empty hallway or blank walls,' Ms Hutchison said. 'The idea is to buy different coloured or sized photo frames and arrange them in an asymmetrical pattern.'","highlights":"Money expert says spending a few hours and a bit of cash can add tens of thousands to your property value at sale .\nAmong her tips are things simple as changing door handles and curtains .\nMichelle Hutchison says paint the walls and the kitchen cupboards .\nOther tips include: Clear the clutter to make you home appear bigger .","id":"92ce51c6b1b29712bd8561dd20e5677983157376"}
{"article":"The Polish father, who may be suffering from amnesia, does not know how he came to lose his memory or be in the UK, and cannot even recall his own name . A Polish father has wandered into the London Embassy with no memory of who he is except that he has a daughter. The mystery man, who may be suffering from amnesia, does not know how he came to lose his memory or be in the UK, and cannot even recall his own name. All that he could remember was that he was from the Poznan area of Poland and has a daughter called Lenka. He may or may not have come from Denmark within the past few days. The man, who was found without identification, taken to hospital after he arrived at the Polish Consulate in central London yesterday afternoon. Currently, the only clue to his identity is a distinctive tattoo of a flower on his right upper arm. He is being cared for at London's St Thomas' Hospital while police appeal for anyone who recognises him to come forward. Scotland Yard said: 'Police are appealing for help to identify a Polish man who has been taken to St Thomas' Hospital suffering memory loss. 'The man attended the Polish Consulate at around 5pm on Thursday, 2 April. 'Due to his lack of memory, he was taken by London Ambulance Service to the hospital as a precaution. 'The man is able to state that he was born in Poland and may have travelled to London from Denmark within the past few days. The mystery man had wandered into the London Embassy with no memory of who he is except that he has a daughter . 'He may be from the Poznan area of Poland and have a daughter called Lenka. 'He is a white man, 5ft 8ins in height of medium build. He has a tattoo of a flower on his right upper arm.' Anyone with information should call Lambeth Missing Person Unit on 101. What is retrograde amnesia? Amnesia is the name given to a disturbance in the ability to recall stored memories. It is usually caused by disease or head injury, but in rare cases can occur apparently spontaneously. The memory loss associated with amnesia can include everything from a person's past or just portions of it. In most cases, it is a temporary condition, lasting from a few seconds to a few hours. But in severe cases, it can last months or even years. There are several different types of amnesia. Retrograde amnesia is an inability to remember any events that occurred before the accident or illness. The leading hypotheses are some form of epileptic event, a problem with blood circulation around, to or from the brain, or some kind of migraine-like phenomenon. Usually, the affected person cannot remember events shortly before their accident or illness at all, but their memories of the distant past are intact, and there is a gradient of memory loss between the two extremes. Retrograde amnesia often lasts for a year, before the patient starts to remember things.","highlights":"Mystery man wandered into Polish Embassy yesterday with no memory .\nThe only clue to his identity is a distinctive flower tattoo on his right arm .\nHe can't recall his own name, how he lost his memory or came to be in UK .\nAll he could remember that he was from Poland and his daughter Lenka .","id":"12354d5f1c0c3fb7c25fcd5eaf984dbba2c9d594"}
{"article":"A racegoer has been questioned by police after he was seen on video deliberately knocking an elderly man to the floor, who then needed to be taken to hospital. The man, who is seen unsteady on his feet and swaying after the day at the races in Aintree, barges into the 63-year-old who then stumbles backwards and falls to the floor in the middle of the road. The 34-year-old man, dressed in a suit, then walks off as people gasp and try to help the victim who was left lying on the floor. Scroll down for video . An Aintree racegoer is seen staggering towards an elderly man, before he barges into him and knocks him onto the floor into a road, leaving the man injured and lying on the floor as he walks off . He was later taken to hospital and treated for bruising on his face. Merseyside Police said the 34-year-old from Formby in Sefton came forward to police late last night and he was interviewed under caution about the alleged assault. He was released this morning pending further inquiries. The man was named on social media as a manager called Terry. Philip Dears, who took the video, posted on Facebook today: 'I have a 2 minute long video of my mate Terry drunk walking home from the races on Thursday, during which he staggers and accidentally bumps into an old man. The man falls and I'm filming the whole situation trying not to laugh. 'When I realise the seriousness of the situation the phone goes off, the laughing stops and I check on the old man, he is hurt on the floor but is being seen to by stewards awaiting medical attention. I turned my attention to Terry and wanted to make sure he gets home safety.' In the post Mr Dears said he and his wife phoned the hospital to check on the elderly man's condition. He also claims the video, which appears on YouTube, has been edited to make it appear the old man was deliberately targeted when this was not the case. The man stumbles backwards and falls, as the video is filmed by a sniggering friend of the alleged perpetrator . He added: 'When you see the video you will see this is a total accidental collision, it's important people get this truth because a lot of people are very upset and I can see why because it looks like a malicious, cowardly attack but this is far from the reality of the situation. ' The footage was brought to the attention of officers by members of the public who had shared it online. Police established the mobile phone footage, shot by a friend of the 34-year-old, was taken outside the racecourse on Thursday evening at about 7pm. He shouts to him 'text bomb' and 'is there any need?' moments before the incident happens as he sniggers uncontrollably from behind his phone. In the video, onlookers can be heard gasping in shock and seen rushing to the man's aid before calling for an ambulance. Officers said the man who was knocked to the floor is from Skelmersdale in West Lancashire. People have expressed their shock at the video. The 63-year-old man is seen standing on the pavement before the other man barges into him and knocks him . He becomes unsteady on his feet from the impact and begins to stumble, before he tumbles backwards . Gasps can be heard on the mobile phone footage as members of the public rush to help the injured man . Paul Hardman wrote: 'That video of the old man at Aintree\u00a0makes me sick to the stomach. Some absolute scum in this world.' Others labelled his behaviour 'disgusting' and 'vile.' Hayley Wills added: 'Hope that horrible man that knocked over the old chap at Aintree gets what he deserves, as well as the sick person that filmed it.' Merseyside Police earlier thanked visitors for making the annual race 'such a safe and enjoyable occasion' and said no arrests were made inside the ground over the three days. An online crowdfunding page has been set up to help the injured man.Concerned wellwishers have already raised \u00a3345 to help the pensioner with his recovery after Joanne Dickson saw Gary's response and launched the fundraising campaign. Page owner Joanne said: 'Most of us tonight have watched the horrible video of the gentleman being knocked to the ground. 'I'm hoping we can raise enough to maybe help him replace his teeth and his phone. 'I don't know the gentleman, I would just like him to know that most decent people are disgusted that, even if the knock was an accident, that no remorse was shown.'","highlights":"Man is seen swaying and then barging into a 63-year-old outside Aintree .\nThe man stumbles and then falls backwards to the floor into the road .\nOnlookers helped and he was taken to hospital and treated for bruising .\nPolice confirmed that the 34-year-old perpetrator in the video has come forward and been interviewed under caution\u00a0for the alleged assault .","id":"087cdf4688a2d165733f6029753c402cc8bbe907"}
{"article":"Francis Coquelin is determined to take his chance at Arsenal and claims he wants to follow in the footsteps of club legend Patrick Vieira. The Frenchman has thrived in the centre of Arsenal's midfield since returning from loan at Championship side Charlton earlier in the season to\u00a0earn plaudits for his robust performances. Vieira was captain during Arsenal's trophy laden beginning to Arsene Wenger's reign and Coquelin hopes he can keep performing to emulate the club legend. Arsenal midfielder Francis Coquelin, who has become an integral part of their midfield, celebrates with fans . 'I\u2019m not going to say to you I am (the new Vieira), obviously I want to be but I think it\u2019s down to the performance I put in every week so I\u2019m just trying to give me best every game so hopefully I can do that in the long term,' Coquelin told BT Sport. On loan at Charlton, the 23-year-old feared he may not play for the Gunners again. 'Well, obviously that was in my head and I think at the time my loan had finished the first month. I could see the injuries over there, I think Arteta was out, Ramsey and it was the time for me to either extend my loan or come back and I extended it and thought maybe I won\u2019t get the chance now,' added Coquelin. The midfielder is determined to prove himself at Arsenal and hold down his place in the starting XI. The 23-year-old is not shy of putting in a robust challenge on opponents as he adds steel to Arsenal's midfield . 'I always had confidence in myself and belief in myself I just need the chance. I got the chance because other people got injured and tried to grab it with both hands and do as well as I could,' he told BT Sport. Arsenal have been much maligned in recent seasons for lacking grit and strength in the centre of the park, but Coquelin is happy to focus on the defensive side of the game. 'The way I think is that I\u2019m just trying to do what\u2019s best for the team. There are other players who can do this job and I\u2019m trying to focus on mine which is to get the ball back and help the team defensively,' added the 23-year-old. Coquelin, tackling Manchester City's David Silva, has managed to establish a starting place in the Arsenal XI . 'Obviously sometimes you want to get involved a little bit more because we play great football and this is Arsenal, you always want to get involved moving forward. But you need to think about the defensive aspect and that is what my job is all about.' Arsene Wenger's side have been in top form in the Premier League, winning their last six matches to close the gap on Manchester City in second and establish a place in the prestigious top four. The Gunners take on Liverpool at the Emirates on Saturday in a pivotal clash in the race for Champions League football, but Arsenal's 'new Vieira' is confident. 'We obviously want to win this game you know, it\u2019s a massive one, really important and we can increase the gap to nine points if we win so yes, I think it\u2019s really important,' said the Frenchman. 'I can\u2019t say definitely because mathematically it won\u2019t be over, so I can\u2019t say that, but yes we see a lot of confidence in us because over the last few months we have had some big results and if we can beat Liverpool it will be another massive one.' Coquelin celebrates with countryman Olivier Giroud as Arsenal managed to win every game in March . See the full interview with Francis Coquelin on \u2018Matchday Live with Fletch & Sav\u2019 from 10am this Saturday on BT Sport 1.

{"article":"The Green Party this morning pledged an end to austerity - with a \u00a390 billion a year spending splurge . The Green Party today demanded an end austerity with a radical \u00a3176 billion a year spending splurge - paying for everything from free prescriptions to organic school dinners for all. State pensions would be increased by more than \u00a360 a week, child benefit doubled, tuition fees scrapped and train fares cut by 10 per cent. The party also pledged to pump an extra \u00a312billion a year into the NHS from day one, introduce universal free elderly care and nationalise the railways. But its election manifesto also revealed a host of left-field pledges - including a 'complete ban' on cages for hens and rabbits, an end to whips in horse racing and mandatory 'equality and diversity lessons' at school. Immigrants will also be given free English classes, while fruit and vegetables will be subsidised and children will be kept out of school until they are seven. Green Party leader Natalie Bennett, unveiling her party's manifesto this morning, defended her 'vision of a fair economy'. She said: 'That fair economy demands the end to austerity. It demands we restore and enhance the essential public services we all but particularly the most vulnerable.' Ms Bennett's list of policy pledges will see government spending rise by \u00a389 billion next year - and by \u00a3176billion by the end of the parliament.\u00a0The extra spending would see an extra \u00a311 billion going on debt interest. Under the party's proposal, an extra \u00a3198 billion of taxes will be introduced to pay for the raft of giveaways \u2013 worth an extra \u00a36,600 for every taxpayer in the UK. Scroll down for video . Green Party leader Natalie Bennett and MP Caroline Lucas unveiled the Green Party general election campaigning at the Arcola Theatre, in London, this morning . Green Party leader Natalie Bennett, unveiling her party's manifesto this morning, defended her 'vision of a fair economy' The new taxes include \u00a325 billion in new 'wealth taxes', levied at two per cent of the entire estate of someone worth \u00a33million or more. It means someone with \u00a310 million in assets would pay an extra \u00a3200,000 a year. Ms Bennett also proposed hitting those earning \u00a3150,000 or more with a new 60 per cent tax rate. There would also be a 'Robin Hood Tax' on financial transactions and a promise to close tax loopholes. Corporation Tax would rise to 30 per cent with duties on cigarettes and alcohol increasing by \u00a31.4bn every year. The party would save cash by scrapping \u00a315 billion of road improvement works. Instead the railways will be renationalised, a move the Greens claim will save \u00a31 billion a year. Some \u00a38 billion will be spent cutting public transport fares and HS2 will be scrapped. Tuition fees will be scrapped at a cost of \u00a34.5 billion, while school funding will be increased by \u00a37 billion. Grammar schools will be turned into comprehensives and the \u2018cruel\u2019 bedroom tax abolished. Ms Bennett told activists next month's election was a landmark for the party. She said it was a 'new kind of politics' where the economy and society could be run for the many and not the few. The leader said: 'It sees the end of the disastrous policy of austerity that is making the poor, the disadvantaged and the young pay for the greed and the fraud of the bankers. 'This is a vision that is exciting increasing numbers of Britons.' Turning to her jobs policy, Ms Bennett said: 'That fair economy demands every worker is paid a living wage. It is really not a radical statement to say that if you work full time you should earn enough money to live on. The party's manifesto listed a series of radical policies, including an extra \u00a312billion for the NHS, free social care for the elderly, the nationalisation of the railways and an end to tuition fees . 'And yet we are the only UK party who is saying the minimum wage should immediately be lifted to a living wage and should reach \u00a310 an hour by 2020.' The Green leader said protection of the NHS was at the heart of the party's election offer as she vowed to strip all private operators from the organisation. She said the 'expensive, destructive' market would be removed from the health service. Ms Bennett said: 'Behind that is an understanding of what privatisation has really meant for so many of our public services. 'It's meant the cutting of the pay and conditions of workers, it's meant the cutting of the quality of services and it has meant the shovelling of public money into private hands.' Other policies include re-nationalising the railways and policies to tackle climate change.","highlights":"Greens pledge to increase government spending by \u00a389bn next year .\nBy 2020, the party would hike spending by \u00a3176bn to almost \u00a31 trillion .\nNHS spending would go up by \u00a312bn, with the railways nationalised .\nFree care for the elderly introduced and tuition fees scrapped .\nTravellers would get new 'nomadic rights' and foreign aid increased .","id":"d62b0b1b6330ae0eb8d1c015ba333f7ede5a7bfd"}
{"article":"It's that time of year again - the in between seasons moment when you look in your wardrobe and genuinely believe there is nothing suitable for the weather outside. In the springtime, the shops are full of new season clothes that are just waiting for a sunny day but still unsuitable for the ever-changing British weather. Cotton dresses, cut-off mini skirts and denim hot pants all need to wait until at least June for an appearance. Scroll down for video . Lily Melrose is a fashion blogger who has 137,000 followers on Instagram . So what to do if you want to embrace summer style now, but keep away from the shops for another couple of months? Fortunately, there are still plenty of crafty ways to keep your wardrobe current - and all you need is a pair of pliers, a glue gun and some scissors. UK stylist and blogger Lily Melrose has come up with 15 style hacks to transform your 2014 wardrobe into 2015 style, without breaking the bank. Read on to find out the DIY tips for making your clothes up to date... Lily models her updated dress, complete with necklace collar . Evening glam . Perfect for a night out with the girls, give your trusty little black dress a gorgeous splash of glam that captures this season\u2019s catwalk style by using an old necklace to create a stunning jewelled collar effect. Use pliers to separate the necklace into individual jewels, position the pieces around the collar and simply use a glue gun to attach, instantly adding \u2018the glam factor\u2019 as seen on Matthew Williamson and House of Holland collections this Spring. Off-duty pastels . Dip-dye is big news this season and a subtle dip-dye effect will add a burst of spring colour to any daytime look. Hand dye and a bowl is all that is needed to update last year\u2019s festival staple, the white vest. Carefully dip the first few inches of the vest into your favourite pastel shade and leave to dry. Lily\u2019s top pick is on-trend blush pink and styled with jeans and a leather jacket for a casual daytime look. Lily shows you how to update sunglasses . DIY designer shades . As the sun comes out, it\u2019s time to dust off last year\u2019s sunglasses. For an effortless, high-impact update, take some jewels or artificial flowers and carefully glue these to the brim or sides of the sunglasses in a symmetrical design. Already a  trend seen on the faces of Dolce & Gabbana and Prada catwalk models this season, this simple and cost-effective design will ensure you\u2019re one step ahead of the fashion set . Dare to bare (your knees) You don\u2019t need to buy a new pair of jeans to sport this season\u2019s biggest denim trend \u2013 plus worn jeans are softer too so they\u2019re much easier to customise. Cut a rip just above the knee cap and then pull out threads and distress the edges for the perfect laid-back cool look. Team with patterned tights underneath for a fresh take on this look. Hair jewelry . The Les Copains label was among those adorning catwalk hairstyles with statement jewellery, but you don\u2019t need to buy them. Carefully attach old necklace jewels (broken down by pliers) onto hairgrips with glue and leave to dry, to turn a boring hair day into a cute one. Headphone sparkle . In fact, embellishment can be used to spruce up any accessory \u2013 take inspiration from Dolce & Gabbana\u2019s bejewelled headphones and add some sparkle to your commute by adding old jewels and diamantes to the outside of your Beats headphones. Fringed boots is a key look for 2015 . Seventies chic . The Seventies look has exploded on to the high street from the catwalks, but instead of going all in with flared jeans and heavy prints, try wearing existing key items in a new way. Channel the vibe with a high waisted skirt (bonus points if it\u2019s the classic Seventies shade of camel), teamed with a tucked in black polo neck. For extra fashion points, cut off the sleeves of the polo neck as seen in Topshop this season for an easy update for spring. Crystal slippers . Take last year\u2019s slipper shoe and update for this season by attaching some studs to them for an edgy spring look. The soft fabric makes it easy to attach them; pierce the fabric with each stud and fold them flat on the inside using pliers to keep them secure and comfortable. Cropped logo T-shirts: Nineties style has been in for a while now, but this year expect to see classic logo T-shirts updated for spring with cut off sleeves and cropped to the waist a la Daisy Lowe.

{"article":"Tim Bresnan insists a good start to the domestic season with LV= County Championship holders Yorkshire could help him make a case for an England Test recall. Bresnan last played in the England whites during the 5-0 Ashes defeat in the winter of 2013\/14, though in recent months he enjoyed a pre-World Cup training session with the squad in Australia and also turned out for the England Lions on their tour of South Africa. More importantly perhaps, the double Ashes-winner helped end Yorkshire's 13-year wait for a title last season, taking 30 wickets in 10 games at an average of 31.57 and making 95 against Nottinghamshire on the day the championship was clinched. Tim Bresnan is keen to give England's selectors no choice but to pick him with wickets and runs for Yorkshire . The right-arm quick last played in whites for England during the Ashes whitewash of winter 2013\/14 . With New Zealand and Australia still to come this year, the Headingley faithful's belief of 'strong Yorkshire, strong England' is already showing good signs with six White Rose players currently on tour in the West Indies. Bresnan says: 'The only thing I can do is get runs and take wickets for Yorkshire' And when asked if he would like to make it number seven, Bresnan said, 'That's up to the selectors.' 'If I do get a load of wickets at the start of the season and get a few runs then I put my case forward, that's all I can do - then it's up to the selectors. 'Obviously, the only thing I can do is get runs and take wickets for Yorkshire. 'That's what I'm looking to do. Whatever happens after that we'll just let it play out. 'We're defending champions, so we're going to do our utmost to defend the title. 'If we play the consistent cricket we did last year - which we are capable of - we'll be there and thereabouts again.' Bresnan did take a step towards that good start on Wednesday, when he reached 400 first-class wickets during Yorkshire's game against Leeds-Bradford MCCU at Headingley. But regardless of his own selection, Bresnan is confident England can put in a good showing against New Zealand and Australia after a turbulent year that also included an early World Cup exit. 'I think we'll do well,' Bresnan said. 'I think they've got all the talent. Yorkshire captain Andrew Gale celebrates as Yorkshire beat Notts to win the 2014 LV County Championship . Yorkshire go to Worcestershire on Apil 14 for the first match of their four-day title defence . 'They just need to start implementing it, start applying that talent and playing good attacking cricket. They are very capable of doing it.' Bresnan did express his disappointment at England's tour matches against St Kitts and Nevis, where some of the Three Lions side have padded up for the hosts in a bid to give the bowlers a higher-quality challenge. 'Obviously, they've tried to make the best of a bad situation,' he said. 'It's very difficult when you go on tour and you don't get decent opposition to practice games. 'But at the end of the day there's nothing England can do about it.'","highlights":"Tim Bresnan pushing for Test recall as\u00a0LV= County Championship begins .\nBresnan last played in the England whites in the winter Ashes of 2013\/14 .\nHe reached 400 first class wickets as Yorkshire face Leeds-Bradford MCCU .\nThe right-arm quick took 30 wickets in 10 games at 31.57 last season .\nYorkshire begin title defence on April 14 against Worcestershire .","id":"914359830b3238cfa13a3e9c4763dd5ed600d1d9"}
{"article":"A federal judge has ordered the Internal Revenue Service to hand over a list of the 298 tea party organizations that it targeted with broad and often intrusive questions when they applied for nonprofit tax-exempt status. The decision from U.S. District Judge Susan Dlott means right-wing groups are a step closer to being allowed to pursue a class-action lawsuit against the IRS. The agency has admitted playing political favorites with the tax code beginning in 2010, when it began applying extra scrutiny to groups with red-flag words like 'patriots' or 'tea party' in their names. While those organizations' applications were held up for years, liberal groups sailed through the process. Federal tax-exempt status is confered on groups that serve a public purpose, including issue advocacy, and allows them to promise tax deductions to their donors. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . F.U.I.R.S.: American conservatives were up in marks in 2013 after the IRS confirmed it had been slow-walking tax-exemption applications from tea party groups based on red-flag words in their names . Lois Lerner, the former IRS official at the heart of the tea party targeting scandal, ran the 'Exempt Organizations' division until late 2013 when she retired with full benefits; the Justice Department said this week that it won't prosecute her for defying a congressional subpoena and refusing to answer questions . Tax-exempt organizations are not permitted to work for or against candidates for public office, but they can use up to half of their funds to make public arguments about political matters like tax policy, the Obamacare insurance overhaul, the environment or foreign policy. Dlott agreed this week that the tea party groups suing the government can pursue their claims that the IRS violated their First and Fifth Amendment rights, along with a section of federal law \u2013 Section 6103 of Title 26 \u2013 that prohibits the government from releasing private information contained in tax returns. When the Treasury Department's Office of Inspector General investigated the IRS's actions, it demanded \u2013 and received \u2013 a list of 298 groups whose tax-exemption applications had been held up. It's this list that the tea party groups want. Their lawsuit aims first to identify a list of 'all dissenting groups targeted for additional scrutiny by the IRS from January 20, 2009, through July 15, 2013.' Dlott could then choose to certify that list as a 'class' of plaintiffs. IRS commissioner John Koskinen has insisted that his agency is no longer targeting conservative groups with special scrutiny, and has offered to green-list any group that promises it will limit its political activity to 40 per cent of its budget \u2013 but some organizations are holdout out, claiming the law entitles them to a 50 per cent limit . The IRS's lawyers claimed that they couldn't provide the court with the names of all the groups, saying they would have to turn over the very documents that Section 6103 requires them to keep confidential. The conservative plaintiffs said they would be happy to have only the spreadsheet that the inspector general got from the IRS. Dlott agreed and ordered the agency to hand it over. 'The Court concludes that the return information sought is directly related to the issue of class certification in this federal court proceeding,' her ruling reads. 'The names of the putative class member organizations and their control dates \u2013 the date which the putative class member organizations submitted their applications for tax exempt status to the IRS \u2013 are directly related to the issue of class certification.' Dlott decided that without the list, the plaintiffs wouldn't be able to show all the disaffected conservative applicants it has already identified share common experiences at the hands of America's tax collectors. Courthouse News Service first reported her ruling. The IRS is the federal agency Americans most love to hate, polling worse in opinion surveys than Congress . A partial list was unearthed by USA Today\u00a0in September 2013, showing that as of 2011 the IRS had questioned the political advocacy of 162 right-wing organizations and delayed approving their tax exemptions. In an IRS spreadsheet published online by the newspaper, partisan government officials characterized the activities of 21 of those groups as 'propaganda.' Dlott also ordered the IRS to tell the court whether or not that list was authentic, The Washington Times reported. Former IRS official Lois Lerner, who has been at the center of the targeting scandal since it emerged in 23 months ago, was facing the possibility of criminal Contempt of Congress charges until the Obama administration's Department of Justice declined on Monday to prosecute her. Lerner, under subpoena in May 2013, delivered an opening statement professing her innocence during a hearing but then refused to answer questions.","highlights":"Right-wing groups want court to let them sue the IRS in a class-action lawsuit for violating their constitutional right to equal treatment .\nIRS applied different criteria to right-wing groups, holding up their applications for years while liberal organizations skated through .\nObama administration fought the release of a list of 298 groups it denied tax-exempt status beginning in 2010, citing privacy concerns .\nJudge in Cincinnati overruled the government and ordered the IRS to hand over the list .\nIf court 'certifies' class-action status, the tea party groups will be free to demand emails, phone records and other documents .","id":"93c1f2e19b66d2c7409aeb7aeb1b03e1f9f3c241"}
{"article":"Ryan Bertrand believes he deserves to be higher up the England pecking order and has pledged to prove his worth to manager Roy Hodgson. The 25-year-old has been one of the standout performers for Southampton, where the left-back moved permanently earlier in the year having impressed on loan from Chelsea. Bertrand has attracted plenty of plaudits for his displays at St Mary's, yet struggled to gain the international recognition many of his colleagues have received. Ryan Bertrand was the fifth left back to be called in to Roy Hodgson's England squad last month . A call-up had been predicted for England's internationals against Lithuania and Italy last month, yet Hodgson plumped for Leighton Baines, Kieran Gibbs and Luke Shaw. Danny Rose was then preferred when Shaw pulled out, only for Bertrand to get the nod once the Tottenham full-back and then Baines dropped out. It meant the Saints left-back travelled to Italy and eventually played the final few minutes of the 1-1 draw in Turin, with his third England cap a peculiar end to the international break. 'It was different,' he said, smiling. 'The international break changed from one extreme to the next, but it was good to get back in the frame and get back in the door. 'It was good to get on the pitch, even though it was very brief. 'When you actually sit there, it hits you that all them years you spent as a kid watching football games, the England games were always the biggest. Bertrand slides in to challenge Everton midfielder James McCarthy earlier this month . 'To finally sit there and be part of it and wear the actual kit and everything, knowing the whole country is cheering you on is fantastic.' England are, in fairness, blessed with strength impressive depth at left-back, with West Ham's Aaron Cresswell another arguably worthy of a call-up. Bertrand appreciates that breadth of options, but hopes to prove to Hodgson that he deserves to be further up the pecking order. 'You know, it's down to (the manager),' he said. 'Whoever he wants to pick, it is his decision. 'I'll just concentrate on my game. I'm confident enough to know that I should be in there, but I don't pick the team so I'll just keep playing.' Bertrand was one of three Southampton players in action that night in Turin, with Nathaniel Clyne starting at right-back for England and Graziano Pelle leading the line for Italy. Bertrand made his move to Southampton from Chelsea permanent in January after impressing on loan . The 29-year-old striker showed no ill-effects of the scoring drought at club level, glancing the Azzurri ahead at the Juventus Stadium - a goal the striker followed up with a first Premier League strike since December 20 in Saturday's 2-0 defeat of Hull. 'I was just thinking it is typical - anyone, anyone but him,' Bertrand said, laughing. 'It was good for him to get a goal. 'The fans have been very supportive, I think. Every week, even when we're warming up, you can hear them cheering him on. 'There's never been any criticism and he has finally broke his duck and got his goal, so hopefully that just continues now.'","highlights":"Ryan Bertrand was fifth left back to be called up by England last month .\nBertrand only included after injuries to Leighton Baines, Luke Shaw and Danny Rose .\nHe replaced Kieran Gibbs in second half away in Italy .\nBertrand belives he should be higher up the England pecking order .","id":"9f0461a3040580adfff29651c848e39941197234"}

{"article":"(CNN)All Elizabeth Sedway wanted was to leave paradise and head home. But she couldn't. Why? Because, according to her, she has cancer. That's what she said in a video posted to Facebook that shows her group packing up from their Alaska Airlines plane as it sat at the gate in Hawaii. \"You're taking me off the airplane because I don't have a doctor's note saying I can fly,\" a woman is heard saying. \"All these people are waiting, and I'm being removed as if  I'm a criminal or contagious, because I have cancer and no note to fly.\" Sedway did eventually get on a flight back to San Jose, California, although she didn't get home until late Tuesday night. And she got an apology. \"We regret the inconvenience Ms. Sedway experienced ... and are very sorry for how the situation was handled,\" Alaska Airlines spokeswoman Bobbie Egan said. \"... While our employee had the customer's well-being in mind, the situation could have been handled differently.\" Her cancer fight notwithstanding, Sedway was in Hawaii in time to celebrate her 14th wedding anniversary. Still, on Monday, she was on a plane to head east. Then, according to her Facebook post, an airline employee who saw Sedway seated in the handicapped section asked her how she was doing. The second time she inquired, Sedway wrote that she responded by saying she sometimes felt weak. That was followed by a call to a doctor, then her removal from the plane. Egan, the Alaska Airlines spokeswoman, acknowledged that the carrier's policy when someone has a medical issue is to call MedLink, a group of ER nurses and doctors. The idea, she explained, is that \"it is better to address medical issues or concerns on the ground rather than in the air, especially on flights to or from Hawaii\" -- which in that case would last five-plus hours over open ocean. The decision to pull Sedway from the flight was done with \"the customer's well-being\" in mind, according to Egan. Still, that doesn't mean it was the right decision. Alaska Airlines since apologized to Sedway \"for the disruption this has caused,\" in addition to refunding her family's tickets and paying for their overnight accommodations.\" Even though she was stuck in Hawaii, Sedway made clear on Facebook that this was a real \"disruption.\" \"Because of this, I will miss my chemotherapy, my children will miss school and my husband will miss important meetings,\" she said.","highlights":"Elizabeth Sedway posted to video to Facebook showing her removal from a plane .\nShe was forced off a flight in Hawaii and told she couldn't head home to California .\nAlaska Airlines later apologized, saying it could have handled the situation differently .","id":"97c0670cd614dc25fe1371f8c5e03b043f0efdc9"}

She is now recovering in\u00a0Delhi\u2019s Safdarjung Hospital (pictured) She was allegedly gang-raped on Sunday when she went outside her house in Kosi Kalan, in Uttar Pradesh's Mathura district, to relieve herself (file image) On Tuesday she set herself on fire using kerosene, according to NDTV, to the shock of her brother, who doused her with water. He told the broadcaster: \u2018When I woke up, I saw her in flames... I poured water on her to put out the flames.\u2019 The girl was screaming for help, according to a neighbour. The accused men have been arrested. There is a heightened sensitivity to the issue of sexual assault in India at the moment after officials last month banned India's Daughter, a documentary about the gang rape and murder of an Indian student in Delhi. Recent attacks in India have resulted in street protests with many calling for more protection for women . Officials said the documentary would cause further disorder if it was shown, following a number of protests and incidents of vigilante justice in the country. The documentary explained the brutal rape and murder of 23-year-old student Jyoti Singh, who was attacked on a bus when she returned home from the cinema. One of the six men convicted of the attack, bus driver Mukesh Singh, was interviewed in prison and told researchers that had Jyoti not fought back she would not have been killed. Her death led to protests throughout India and outraged the world. Last month an angry mob were seen on video footage beating a man to death in the street who was accused of raping and murdering an 11-year-old girl. Video footage has emerged of the brutal prolonged attack on the 18-year-old, which was watched by a jeering 1,000-strong crowd in Nagaland in eastern India. Ibo Cha was said to have been beaten for an hour before he died of his injuries. The footage was shot in September last year after the girl's body was found in woodland, enraging locals. But it only came to light after earlier this year alleged rapist Syed Sarif Khan was kidnapped from prison and dragged through the streets of the same area. He was then stripped naked and beaten to death. He was accused but not convicted of raping a 19-year-old female student multiple times. Later Nagaland Government said he was innocent. Jyoti Singh Pandey, a physiotherapy student, was gang raped as she travelled on a bus. The 23-year-old suffered in hospital for 13 days from her injuries before she died. Vinay Sharma, 20, Akshay Thakur, 28, Pawan Gupta, 19, and Mukesh Singh, 26, were all sentenced to death for her rape. Ram Singh, co-accused and widely considered the leader of the group, was found dead in his cell. A minor also found guilty was sentenced to three years in a reformatory institution. Her death sparked angry protests in India and internationally about misogyny in the country. The attention forced judges to prioritise the case and the lawyer's association in Saket reportedly refused to defend the perpetrators.

In it, a small boy named Harry Davies-Carr is seen happily sitting with his baby brother Charlie on his lap - until Charlie painfully makes a snap for one of his older sibling's digits. Now the pair, from Buckinghamshire, who are now aged 11 and nine, have given an interview to children's TV programme Newsround, to talk about the video that changed their lives. Scroll down for video . The boys are they are not: Harry (left) is now 11, whilst his younger brother Charlie (right) is now nine . The YouTube pioneers told CBBC reporter Ricky Boleto that the video was originally filmed for the family to send to the brothers' godfather who lives in America. However, it quickly went viral, becoming an early online hit when it was uploaded eight years ago, going on to amass more than 816million views on YouTube. Harry told the children's TV show that he now finds watching the video funny, saying: 'It makes me laugh.' Charlie said he didn't find it embarrassing but said: 'I think it's a bit odd that loads of people have watched it. Their father Howard, had only ever uploaded the video because it was too big to send over email. Harry (left) and Charlie (right) starred in the Youtube clip which has amassed millions and millions of views . The show also reveals that the boys' video has had more views than Taylor Swift, One Direction and even Adele. Their parents have since made thousands of pounds from advertising and sponsorship deals off the back of the clip. Howard said at the time: 'The clip only went up as I wanted to share it with the boys' godfather. I was naive about the whole YouTube thing.

{"article":"Michael Phelps is aiming to compete in a fifth Olympics next year in Rio, although the 18-time Olympic champion won't swim in the world championships this summer. Phelps confirmed his intention to make one last run at the Olympics on Wednesday. 'You guys heard it here first,' he told reporters at Skyline Aquatic Center, where he will be competing in his first meet since serving a six-month suspension by USA Swimming after a second drunken driving arrest last fall. 'I am looking forward to next year. I don't think it's too hard to really realize why I came back.' 18-time Olympic champion Michael Phelps is aiming to compete in a fifth Olympics next year in Rio . But Phelps said he won't be swimming at the world meet in Russia in August as part of the punishment set forth by the sport's U.S. governing body. He had already qualified in three events before being banned from the last major international meet before the Rio de Janeiro Olympics. 'I really enjoy being on those trips,' he said. 'That's why it is painful to think that I won't have the chance to compete at worlds.' There had been informal discussions about Phelps being reinstated to the US team for worlds, but it would have meant removing swimmers that were named to the team in his absence. 'By no means do I want this to be a distraction from the team,' he said. 'No way would I ever want to displace a member of that team.' Phelps in action during a practice session Mesa, Arizona on Wednesday . Phelps is back in Arizona, where he attended 45 days of inpatient alcohol rehabilitation after being arrested on DUI charges in his hometown of Baltimore last September. He offered no specifics about his treatment, which he continued in Maryland. He also enrolled in Alcoholics Anonymous. 'The last couple of months have probably been the hardest I've ever had to go through in my entire life,' he said. 'I take full responsibility for all of my actions. I've hurt a lot of people and it's been terrible.' The 29-year-old swimmer was sentenced to 18 months of probation. He said he's done more growing up in recent months than he has in his entire life. 'I have been able to come out on a better end, have a clear head,' he said. 'I don't think I've ever been like this once in my life.' Phelps' longtime coach, Bob Bowman, acknowledged his star swimmer's second arrest for drunken driving made it 'pretty hard to convince me that anything was going to lead us back to something that we'd be proud of.' Phelps called Bowman a few times from rehab, which the coach described as 'really weird' because he typically never heard from Phelps away from the pool. Bowman visited Phelps during treatment, still skeptical that the swimmer was there for any reason other than he had to be. But Bowman left thinking differently. Phelps is back in Arizona, where he attended 45 days of inpatient alcohol rehabilitation . 'I just had no doubt that he had changed in a way that was really meaningful,' Bowman said. 'He was completely different and it's been that way every day since he's been back.' Phelps pleaded guilty after his first drunken driving arrest in 2004. Five years later, a photo was published of him using a marijuana pipe at a party, which drew a three-month suspension and caused some sponsors to drop him. Phelps knows not everyone will believe he's contrite and has changed. 'If somebody doesn't believe the words that are coming out of my mouth that's their choice,' he said. 'I, of course, would like to show everybody in the world that I am in a different place and I am much better than I ever have been. I understand that's going to take a lot of time. This week will be the first week that I can start that.' Phelps will be competing in Mesa for the first time since the Pan Pacific Championships last August. The Arizona meet was where Phelps made his comeback a year ago after an extended retirement following the 2012 Olympics. Phelps adjusts North Baltimore Aquatic Center team-mate Allison Schmidt's cap during practice . He isn't sure what to expect, having only recently returned to the kind of hard training he did before the 2008 Beijing Games, where he won a record eight gold medals. Phelps is falling back on the mentality he used for much of his career. 'I would just get up and swim as hard as I could and leave it in the water,' he said. 'That's what I'm going to do here. I know I'm more prepared now than I was at this time last year.' His first event is the 100-meter butterfly on Thursday, when he'll compete against longtime rival Ryan Lochte.

Ed Balls was left briefly stumped by a basic maths question today after he gave a speech in Leeds . He was asked to work out the multiplication at the Q&A after he last month revealed that he still relies on his mother-in-law for help with maths. During an interview on Good Morning Britain, Labour's shadow chancellor confessed he was relieved he had not been asked any maths questions live on TV. He told host Susanna Reid: 'I was pleased you didn't ask me any maths questions this morning.' Asked how he was with fractions, Mr Balls replied: 'Luckily my mother-in-law is a maths teacher so she is the expert when it comes to maths.' A shocked Miss Reid interrupted: 'You cannot tell me that the shadow chancellor relies on his mother-in-law to do his maths.'

{"article":"An elderly couple have been charged as investigations deepen into the discovery of a mass dog grave  containing the carcasses of 55 greyhounds. The 71-year-old man and 64-year-old woman were\u00a0charged with unlawfully possessing a firearm after a police search found a rifle and ammunition in a home in Bundaberg on Thursday. The carcasses were in various states of decomposition when found by a member of the public 360 kilometres  north of Brisbane in Vera Scarth-Johnson Wildflower Reserve, and it is thought that the site is a common dumping ground for unwanted racing greyhounds. Scroll down for video . An elderly couple have been charged as investigations deepen into the discovery of a mass dog grave containing the carcasses of 55 greyhounds . The shocking grisly photos show the decomposed bodies and burnt out skeletons of the greyhounds. Their carcasses lie in thick bush grass and some are still covered in dark brown fur with gun shot wounds clearly visible. There have been reports that the remains of the animals are scattered over an area of 200m around the reserve and no efforts have been made to conceal them. The 64-year-old woman is known in the local area as a greyhound trainer and when police issued her with a search warrant she put up a fight, claiming she had no idea what they were talking about. Police found a .22 calibre gun, ammunition and a baseball bat in the woman's home. The couple, both from Bundaberg, will appear in the Bundaberg Magistrates Court on Friday. A Queensland Police and RSPCA taskforce, set up after the greyhound racing industry was rocked by the live baiting scandal in February, found ammunition shells from a .22 calibre gun at the bush site in nearby Coonarr. The 71-year-old man and 64-year-old woman were charged with unlawfully possessing a firearm after a police search found a rifle and ammunition in a home in Bundaberg on Thursday . Local speculation suggests the site is a common dumping ground for `wasted' dogs used by people in the industry. Police haven't been able to confirm reports that microchips were also discovered. The shocking scene was, in the words of Detective Superintendent Mark Ainsworth, 'nothing short of abhorrent'. Post-mortem examinations will reveal the cause of death but Ainsworth said: 'I will say that a number of spent .22 cartridge shells were found in the vicinity as well.' And it's unlikely to be the last horrific sight he and his colleagues are met with. 'We've not even tipped the iceberg yet,' he said on Thursday morning. The carcasses were in various states of decomposition when found by a member of the public 360 kilometres north of Brisbane in Vera Scarth-Johnson Wildflower Reserve, and it is thought that the site is a common dumping ground for unwanted racing greyhounds . 'It could be somebody within the industry that knows the remoteness of that area up there and knows that it's a safe place to dispose of greyhounds that can't perform within the greyhound industry,' he said before the couple were arrested. Speaking to 9News, local resident Lloyd Blake said: 'We're quite disgusted that the dogs were dumped in our area and we hope at the end of the day that the severe fire that we had here in November is not related to the burning of the dogs.' Fires ripped through the area in February and police are now investigating whether the fires were deliberately lit and linked to the burning of the greyhound carcasses. It's also believed the animals were killed prior to the ABC's live baiting expose, judging by the level of decomposition. Racing Queensland's own probe into the use of live piglets, possums, rabbits and other small animals to train race dogs has resulted in more than 30 trainers being banned or stood down pending an internal review. The 64-year-old woman is known in the local area as a greyhound trainer and when police issued her with a search warrant she put up a fight, claiming she had no idea what they were talking about . The shocking scene was, in the words of Detective Superintendent Mark Ainsworth, 'nothing short of abhorrent' It's not yet known if any of those banned or suspended are those operating around Bundaberg that have been identified by police. But Queensland Greyhound Breeders, Owners and Trainers Association president Tony Zammit maintains the wider industry has been tarnished by the action of a few 'villains and rogues'. While horrified to learn of the mass killing, he said comments it foreshadowed even more revelations of animal mistreatment were premature. 'To me, it's an exaggerated statement,' he said. 'We haven't heard the full story yet.' Speaking at a press conference Police Minister Jo-Ann Miller was furious and appalled at the 'mass murder'. 'The people who have perpetrated this crime to me are oxygen thieves , they are cowards and they are pathetic,' she said. Bundaberg Greyhound Club president Stephen Bland took to Facebook to express shock at the discovery. Post-mortem examinations will reveal the cause of death but Ainsworth said: 'I will say that a number of spent .22 cartridge shells were found in the vicinity as well' Australia has one of the largest greyhound racing industries in the world. Live baiting has been banned and criminalised for decades. @QPSmedia@RSPCAQld 'We are appalled by the news and are doing all we can to find whomever is responsible for this disgraceful act,' he said. Greyhounds usually have relaxed, amicable temperaments and the state's Police Minister Jo-Ann Miller used social media to note her outrage.

{"article":"ALL DAY LONG . By Joanna Biggs . (Serpent\u2019s Tail \u00a314.99) Famously and memorably, the poet Philip Larkin asked: 'Why should I let the toad work \/ Squat on my life?' He longed to be '... courageous enough \/ To shout Stuff your pension! - but knew he never would. Coffee morning: Britain at work . The tyranny of the nine-to-five is about money (of course), but also about moral worth: we work because we know we should 'pull our weight' in society's tug-of-war. On any morning, in any town or city all over the world, people stream into their places of work, some driven by a sense of vocation, some by resigned boredom, some by greed, some by need. Surely it is work, not love, which makes the world go round? Joanna Biggs offers an excellent contribution to our knowledge of the world of work in all its variety - not through tedious sociological analysis (thank goodness), but through the stories of real people she has interviewed all over the country. Reading this book reminds me how times have changed dramatically since my generation left school or college in the Sixties with no worries about finding a job. We were lucky. Joanna Biggs makes it bleakly clear that for many people today, 'the idea that good work brings a good life no longer holds'. Biggs divides her workers in interesting categories, yoking disparate occupations in terms of their overall function. So the 'Making' chapter gives us a potter, a shoemaker and (yes) a robot, which introduces us to its maintenance engineers. 'Serving' includes a sex worker, two baristas, a call centre adviser and a political special adviser. Those 'Repairing' are a rabbi, an Army major and a nurse, while those 'Leading' are a company director, a stay-at-home mum (inspired, that one) and a hereditary lord. Biggs writes: 'I continuously heard that people loved their jobs, and sometimes this worried me' The scope of the book is broad. We meet those who are selling, entertaining, thinking, caring - as well as a curious clutch of people Biggs lumps together under 'Starting': a goldsmith's apprentice (one of my favourites), a rebellious intern, an entrepreneur specialising in 'start-up' technologies, an unemployed graduate. There's also a 56-year-old man on Mandatory Work Activity, usually known as 'workfare' - the Government initiative designed for those on Jobseeker's Allowance, to help them 'gain a better understanding of the discipline and focus required for work... while at the same time making a contribution to the community'. Joanna Biggs clearly does not think very much of 'workfare': in fact, it's clear she despises the scheme. Here, although of course anyone can see that the system is not perfect, I wish she hadn't editorialised so overtly. I really wanted to hear more about what John thought of his life. A book which aims to give the reader much-needed insight into other people's lives (and it certainly does that) seems to me to be spoilt by degenerating into a student newspaper leader: 'A citizen's income set at the right level - \u00a3320 a week is the current estimate - would kill off the sort of unproductive and low-paid jobs that have proliferated since 2008 in the UK.' At that point the author does not speculate what disastrous effects such indiscriminate largesse could have on the economy, with inevitable repercussions for the very men and women she has met. ALL DAY LONG By Joanna Biggs . In the Seventies I was a huge admirer of the work of America's Studs Terkel and England's Tony Parker, both oral historians who aimed to give insight into the lives of those with no voice, by using recorded interviews, carefully transcribed, with no questions included and no comment or judgment. It was a magnificent technique which catapulted the reader movingly (and sometimes shockingly) into the hearts and minds of prisoners, drifters, miners, people on a housing estate, and so on. You felt you got to know them without the author-interviewer standing in the way - although, of course, all interviews have to be edited. Joanna Biggs invokes Terkel: 'I've often wondered what (he) would think of how we think about work now.' Well, I reckon the great man would continue to record what he heard, without surprise, and without trying to fit life stories into a pre-conceived mould. In contrast, Biggs writes: 'I continuously heard that people loved their jobs, and sometimes this worried me: it felt as if work was becoming more insecure on one hand, and the work ethic increasingly revered on the other.' At the end, she lays her cards on the table, confessing that as she listened to people's stories, 'I most often wished for the way we work as a society to be organised more fairly and hoped for more resistance to the way it's organised now.' That's the trouble with the workers, you see. They've always been unpredictable individuals who may like or dislike their jobs but just get on with life, turning their backs on revolution.","highlights":"Joanna Biggs tells\u00a0the stories of real people she has interviewedin the UK .\nShe offers an excellent contribution to our knowledge of the world of work .\nConfesses she hoped for more resistance to the way society is organised .","id":"23276e51baad3d935ed5fd3c2c0e24d84ee3e046"}

{"article":"Former Toronto Mayor Rob Ford has announced that he will undergo 'very serious' surgery to remove a cancerous tumor in his abdomen. In an emotional press conference on Thursday, the 45-year-old politician said he met with doctors who told him chemotherapy and radiation have shrunk the tumor to a size where they can operate. Four surgeons will carry out the eight- to ten-hour operation on May 11, and he will remain in hospital for 10 to 14 days, he said. He hopes to return to work in September. 'I'm just lucky to be alive today and I'm just lucky that I'm getting another chance at life,' he said. Scroll down for video . Emotional: Rob Ford announced on Thursday that he will undergo a lengthy operation to remove a cancerous tumor from his abdomen in May. He hopes to return to work as a councilor in September, he said . Ford was diagnosed with malignant liposarcoma - a rare type of soft tissue cancer that begins in fat cells or fatty tissue - last year, forcing him to quit his bid for re-election for mayor. Instead, he ran for his old seat in city council and won. The success came after he acknowledged in 2013 that he had smoked crack cocaine in one of his 'drunken stupors' - but despite the emergence of embarrassing footage of him allegedly taking the drug, he refused to resign and instead completed a stint at rehab. The City Council stripped Ford of most of his powers but lacked the authority to force him out of office because he wasn't convicted of a crime. Ford's antics made him the target of late-night television comedians in the US. Battle: Ford, pictured talking to deputy Mayor Denzil Minnan-Wong last December, has undergone five rounds of chemotherapy and nearly a month of radiation, which has shrunk his tumor significantly . Having a laugh: Toronto's Chief Budget Officer Councillor Frank Di Giorgio is pictured with  Ford during a budget meeting in January 2014 - before the embattled mayor headed to rehab . Last March, he appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! after months of wooing by the talk-show host, who introduced his guest by saying he 'has tripped, bumped, danced, argued and smoked his way into our national consciousness.' After his cancer diagnosis, his brother Doug took his place in the mayoral race but he lost out to Mayor John Tory. He underwent 27 days of radiation and five rounds of chemotherapy and the 14cm tumor found in his lower abdomen has now shrunk to a manageable size,\u00a05.6 by 4.3 by 4.6 cm, he said. He said doctors are optimistic but there\u2019s a chance the cancer could come back after surgery. Ford thanked his wife Renata - who was at the press conference - his family and the people of Toronto, as well as his medical staff, for their support.","highlights":"Ford announced at a press conference on Thursday that he will undergo a 8-10 hour surgery to remove a tumor on May 11 .\nHe was diagnosed with malignant liposarcoma - a rare type of soft tissue cancer that begins in fat cells or fatty tissue - last year .\nHe had refused to step down as mayor in light of his crack and alcohol binges, but the diagnosis forced him to give up the role .\nBut he ran for his old seat in city council and won .","id":"c42afe906ce8886fd8741076140a71be58a21958"}
{"article":"Sydney-bound winger Joe Burgess scored his first Super League hat-trick as Wigan secured their first away win of the season, but they were made to work hard by struggling Wakefield in an error-strewn game at the Rapid Solicitors Stadium. Burgess, who is joining Sydney Roosters at the end of the year, scored three of the Warriors' seven tries in a 40-22 victory - their first Super League success in West Yorkshire for 18 months - to help his side climb above St Helens into second place in the table, at least for 24 hours. It was a third consecutive win for Shaun Wane's men and a fifth from their last six matches but their hard-to-please coach will be far from happy with their performance and his mood will have worsened by a hamstring injury to centre Anthony Gelling. Joe Burgess (left) was in fine form for Wigan with his first Super League hat-trick . It was a ninth successive defeat for the Wildcats, who remain rooted to the foot of the table, but a vast improvement on their 80-0 rout by Warrington in their previous league game. Still without seven senior players through injury, Wakefield gave a debut to Widnes loanee prop Ben Kavanagh, a first start to young loose forward Jordan Crowther and a first Super League outing for former Leeds prop Ian Kirke. And their problems worsened when Kirke sustained a broken thumb and loose forward Danny Washbrook damaged a rib to leave coach James Webster cursing his luck. Yet the Wildcats made the best possible start, with makeshift centre Matt Ryan breaking clear from his own half to create a try for full-back Craig Hall, who kicked the first of his three goals. Wigan looked to have gained control, however, when prop Dom Crosby took Michael McIlorum's pass to crash over for his first try for more than two years and scrum-half Matty Smith skipped through Wildcats defence for a solo score. Flying wingers Burgess and Dom Manfredi both produced clinical finishes to double the Warriors' try tally before half-time but the gritty Yorkshiremen would not lie down as the game opened up after Sam Powell (Wigan) and Tim Smith (Wakefield) were despatched to the sin bin following a skirmish. Daniel Smith got skipper Danny Kirmond through a chink in the visitors' defence for one try and stand-off Pita Godinet added another on the stroke of half-time, darting over from dummy half, as Wakefield eyed a repeat of last year's shock win over Wane's men. Burgess scorched over for his second try within two minutes of the re-start following more smart work from his centre partner Dan Sarginson as Wigan established a 12-point lead for the third time. But Godinet pounced on a stray pass from former Wigan's Wakefield forward Taulima Tautai to get winger Chris Riley over for a fourth Wildcats try to cut the deficit to 30-22. However, the game always looked to be within Wigan's grasp and they opened up a three-score lead on 57 minutes when prop Lee Mossop proved unstoppable from 10 metres out. Burgess was denied when referee Robert Hicks ruled a knock-on from George Williams' grubber kick but he duly completed his hat-trick on 63 minutes after accepting Williams' cut-out pass to cross at the corner.","highlights":"Wigan secured their first away win of the Super League season .\nJoe Burgess scored three of the Warriors' seven tries .\nWigan climb above St Helens into second place, at least for 24 hours .","id":"8cf1f869e402de48a722f6e97d01f3debb6215be"}

And it's appreciated by the Pacman, who posted an image of the pair expressing his gratitude to the Fast and Furious 7 star on his Twitter page. 'Thank you for visiting me @RondaRousey and for your support. God Bless!' he wrote. Back in February Rousey, 28, who has signed a multi-fight deal with the UFC but is also keen to get in the boxing ring, told TMZ Sports why she was in camp Pacquiao for the richest fight in history. Pacquiao is preparing for his May 2 megafight against Floyd Mayweather in Las Vegas . Rousey, the UFC women's bantamweight champion, recently starred in the film Fast and Furious 7 . 'Pacquiao's been very, very nice me, so I'm going to root for him,' Rousey said. She follows a host of other celebrities to back Pacquiao, including The Fighter star Mark Wahlberg, NFL quarterback Tim Teebow, basketball legend Robert Jaworski and actor Robert Duvall who have met with the boxer at his camp. But none of them have the distinction, as Rousey does, of being the only person promised a free ticket to Pacquiao-Mayweather at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas.

Pacquiao is put through his paces at Wild Card Boxing ahead of the richest fight in history . Promoter Bob Arum was taken by Rousey's comments that she would spend her combined career fight winnings to get a seat as close to the ring as possible for the fight. Arum said he was a huge fan of Rousey's and said he wanted to show his support by offering her a prized seat. Rousey is by far the biggest draw in women's UFC and her star has risen further of late with a spectacular fight scene with Michelle Rodriguez in the latest Fast and Furious film and a cameo as herself in the Entourage movie. It's no distraction from her day job though as Rousey continues to dominate her division. Her 11th win came as the headline act in UFC184 on February 28 with a record-breaking 14 second arm-bar finish on Cat Zingano, who was previously unbeaten to that point. Mayweather has plenty of celebrity friends of his own with pop singer Justin Bieber regularly walking with him . Pacquiao himself has been showing his versatility by recording and releasing his own walkout music for his bout with Mayweather, which was released this week. The born-again Christian also spoke on Sunday at the non-denominational Shepherd Church Westside in Los Angeles about his rocky past and how he's a changed man. 'There was a problem in our family because the fame goes to my head,' Pacquiao admitted to . Pastor Dudley Rutherford. 'I know how to gamble, I know how to drink, a lot of girls, womanizing, like that. You know I accept that because that's the old Manny Pacquiao.'","highlights":"UFC woman's bantamweight champion visited Manny Pacquiao's camp .\nRousey is backing Pacquiao in his megafight against Floyd Mayweather .\nPacman thanked Rousey for her support in a Twitter picture together .\nREAD: Mayweather vs  Pacquiao referee to earn $10,000 (\u00a36,800) on May 2 .\nWATCH: Pacquiao releases music video ahead of Mayweather bout .","id":"813587d0a48f3f02ad5234226d39af808151a83b"}

Daphne said of the collection, in which she appears with 22-year-old Flo Dron: 'The & Other Stories\u2019 collection that is featured in this story is truly relaxed and timeless with a modern twist, all in lovely colours.' 86-year-old Daphne Selfe has starred in the campaign for Vans and & Other Stories alongside Flo Dunn, 22 . The images show the new footwear which sees Stories make a twist on the classic vans slip on.\u00a0The shoes are then worn with pieces from the brands SS2015 collection. Daphne's career originally began  in 1949 and she once told the Express: 'Modelling was respectable then so my parents were very happy for me to do it and it was fabulous. 'I still think the Fifties was the best time to be a model because the clothes were so lovely. Of course we were much more innocent. 'There was no television, only the radio and we'd never heard of drugs.' At the time of the interview in 2011 Daphne, from Baldock, Hertfordshire,\u00a0was still commanding \u00a31,000 per day for her work. Daphne looks cool and relaxed as she models the & Other Stories collection alongside the customised shoes . 'That rate is quite rare but it's very nice when it comes and helps the pension,' she said. The model also comes from a time when it was OK to not be super skinny: 'I'm a big-boned person and back in 1950 I was 10st 7lb, although nobody told me to lose weight. 'I didn't do anything to make myself thin but once I had three children I lost weight and now I'm 8st. 'My waist is 28'' so I can sometimes get into a size eight on a shoot but I wear a 10 for comfort. I think it's ridiculous and very sad that some of the models now have become so skeletal.' Flo and Daphne sit side by side as they model almost matching outfits for the two brands . Daphne wears a day time look with lace up vans (left) changing into a red dress for another picture (right) The model has never had any surgery and shies away from botox.

Anyway, I couldn\u2019t afford it!\u2019 She previously revealed to the MailOnline that she posed nude back in the day for artists such as Barbara Hepworth. The outfits chosen for the campaign look great no matter what age the model is . She revealed that she keeps her grey hair, which is brushed down around her shoulders in the new campaign, long because it is cheaper. She said: 'My hair is long now because it\u2019s cheaper, I don\u2019t have to do anything, but put it in a topknot or a French pleat. 'It avoids that old lady permed look, lengthens the neck and lifts the face. I\u2019ve got so many friends who don\u2019t touch the make-up pot. You should keep looking nice, it makes you feel so much better.\u2019 In modelling shots taken from the earlier part of her career Daphne shows off her effortless grace . Daphne is known for her timeless beauty and has previously admitted to never having had any surgery . Daphne took part in the Dare To Wear campaign in 2014 for the Trafford Center in Manchester . Over the last few years Daphne has landed a number of campaigns with well known brands. In 2013 she was chosen to work for TK Maxx and last year she fronted the Dare To Wear campaign for the Trafford Center in Manchester. Daphne says that she has good genes and maintains a healthy lifestyle: 'My parents gave me good genes and health, and I have always eaten sensibly.

{"article":"(CNN)Remains of up to nearly 400 unaccounted for service members tied to the USS Oklahoma at Pearl Harbor will be exhumed this year, the Defense Department announced Tuesday. The hope is that most of the battleship's sailors and Marines can be identified. \"The secretary of defense and I will work tirelessly to ensure your loved one's remains will be recovered, identified, and returned to you as expeditiously as possible, and we will do so with dignity, respect and care,\" Deputy Secretary of Defense Bob Work said in a statement. \"While not all families will receive an individual identification, we will strive to provide resolution to as many families as possible.\" The USS Oklahoma sank when it was hit by torpedoes on December 7, 1941, during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. A total of 429 sailors and Marines on the ship were killed. Thirty-five crew members were positively identified and buried in the years immediately after the attack, according to the Defense Department. By 1950, all unidentified remains were laid to rest as unknowns at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific. In 2003, five more service members were identified, with the help of historical evidence from Pearl Harbor survivor Ray Emory, 93. Emory, a native of Peoria, Illinois, was serving as a seaman first class on the light cruiser USS Honolulu that fateful day. After the war, Emory worked in Washington state before moving to Hawaii about 30 years ago. The retiree made it his mission to ensure graves are properly identified. \"It's something I looked forward to for a long time,\" he told CNN about Tuesday's announcement. Speaking by phone from Honolulu, Emory said that proper identification means a lot to the families of those who lost loved ones -- and to him. Next of kin were being notified starting Tuesday.

{"article":"Gary Hooper came off the bench to snatch a dramatic stoppage-time winner to keep Norwich City on track for automatic promotion in the Sky Bet Championship after Neil Lennon's battling Bolton came within minutes of gaining a point. Former Celtic star Hooper's goal sparked jubilant scenes on the Canaries bench in contrast to the dejection of his one-time Parkhead boss Neil Lennon. Indeed, Hooper had been a transfer target for Lennon earlier in the season so his winning goal was a double blow for the Ulsterman. Gary Hooper celebrates after earning Norwich three points with a stoppage-time winner against Bolton . Former Celtic striker Hooper is mobbed by his team-mates as Norwich remained second in the Championship . Bolton:\u00a0Bogdan, Vela, Dervite, Ream, Moxey, Bannan, Walker (Janko 87), Feeney, Gudjohnsen (Danns 82), Heskey, Le Fondre . Subs not used:\u00a0Lonergan, M Davies, Trotter, Rochinha, McCarthy . Booked: Walker, Moxey . Scorer(s): Le Fondre . Norwich: Ruddy; Whittaker (R Bennett 71), Martin, Bassong, Olsson, Tettey, Howson, Dorrans, Hoolahan (Grabban 57), Redmond (Hooper 66), Jerome . Subs not used:\u00a0Rudd, E Bennett, O'Neil, Odjidja-Ofoe . Booked: Bennett . Scorer(s): Dorrans 9, Hooper 90+ . Referee: James Adcock . Graham Dorrans gave the Canaries an early lead as his right-footed free-kick deflected off Josh Vela into the net, but Adam Le Fondre looked to have rescued a point and extended Bolton's unbeaten run to four games. Instead, Hooper lobbed keeper Adam Bogdan - as the Wanderers defenders switched off - to score an invaluable goal. Lennon had promised his side would spoil a few parties in the remaining games of the season with Brantford and Bournemouth coming up in the next few weeks. That looked to be the case until Hooper's strike made it five wins in the last six meetings between the teams. Norwich made the perfect start with Dorrans' deflected free-kick after Vela took down Nathan Redmond on the edge of the area. The Canaries should have doubled their advantage six minutes later as Sebastien Bassong rose highest at a corner but cleared Bogdan's crossbar by some distance. Hooper lobs the ball over Adam Bogdan to spark jubilant scenes on the Canaries bench . Former West Brom midfielder Graham DOrrans celebrates after giving the visitors the lead on Saturday . And the visitors were in total control when Wanderers drew level totally against the run of play. It was so one-sided manager Lennon was poised to bring on Neil Danns to shore up his midfield. Instead, youngster Tom Walker, who had been guilty of delaying a cross moments earlier, learned his lesson. His flashing centre from the left picked out Le Fondre inside the six-yard box and the on-loan Cardiff City striker, back in the side after missing the Easter Monday trip to South Wales, finished with ease. Walker continued to prove a threat to the visitors' defence with his elusive running and was harshly booked for a foul on Wes Hoolahan. Liam Feeney shot narrowly wide from another Walker cross that fizzed beyond three static Norwich defenders before the Canaries rediscovered their composure. Top scorer Cameron Jerome, whose double won the reverse fixture at Carrow Road last October, brought a smart save out of Bogdan while the Hungarian international needed treatment after punching away another dangerous-looking Dorrans free-kick. Norwich striker Cameron Jerome heads towards goal during the clash at the Macron Stadium . The second half was much more competitive and Wanderers were more of a match for their high flying visitors. So much so that Neil brought on Lewis Grabban after 57 minutes for Hoolahan. And Grabban made an immediate impact, bringing out a save from Bogdan before Tim Ream cleared off the line from first-half scorer Dorrans. However, Bolton had their moments going forward too with Le Fondre trying cheekily to chip John Ruddy while Alex Tettey cleared off the line after Dorian Dervite narrowly failed to connect with Walker's corner. Neil's intention's were clear and with 20 minutes left had made his full set of substitutions with Hooper replacing Nathan Redmond and Steven Whittaker going off for Ryan Bennett. The visitors were incensed they did not get a penalty when Russell Martin's cross hit Dean Moxey on the hand. But any ill luck was cancelled out in injury time as hot shot Hooper slotted his winner.","highlights":"Norwich beat Bolton 2-1 at the Macron Stadium in the Championship .\nGraham Dorrans gave the visitors the lead inside 10 minutes .\nAdam Le Fondre drew Neil Lennon's side level after 18 .\nGary Hooper won the game for Norwich in the closing moments .\nNorwich remain second ahead of Watford on goal difference .","id":"51330b87d3a7fc3efd854f2a569364c55ff5426a"}

'Jean-Marie Le Pen seems to have descended into a strategy . somewhere between scorched earth and political suicide,' said Marine . Le Pen, who took over the party from her father in 2011. 'His status as honorary president does not give him the . right to hijack the National Front with vulgar provocations . seemingly designed to damage me but which unfortunately hit the . whole movement,' she said. Ms Le Pen has tried to rid the anti-immigrant party of . its anti-Semitic image and widen its voter appeal as she readies . a bid for the French presidency in 2017.

December local elections where the party is hoping to make gains . after strong performances in town hall and departmental votes. Ms Le Pen already distanced herself from her father last . June after a quip about a French Jewish singer that included an . implied reference to concentration camp ovens. But last week Mr Le Pen said he had 'never regretted' his comments about the Second World War gas chambers, which is likely to revive accusations that the far-Right party remains anti-Semitic. Mr Le Pen, who is still an MEP, said: 'The gas chambers were a detail of the war, unless we admit that the war was a detail of the gas chambers!' During an interview on BFM TV in Paris, Mr Le Pen said 'the truth' should 'not shock anyone', and that historical reality should not be used to portray him as anti-Jewish. 'This case was manipulated against me by introducing a hint of anti-Semitism,' said Mr Le Pen. 'I challenge anyone to name an anti-Semitic phrase in my political life.

Following the comments, Ms Le Pens said she 'deeply disagreed' with her 'deliberately provocative' father. Speaking to the website of Le Figaro daily, she said: 'I deeply disagree with him. 'I take note of what he said but I believe that those coming over to vote for us understand what is going on. He is being deliberately provocative.' Ms Le Pen's party regularly wins up to 25 per cent of the popular vote at local and regional elections, and Ms Le Pen intends to stand for the job of president in 2017. Under her leadership, the party has deepened its roots across France, winning outright control of some town halls and getting its officials elected onto the councils of 'departements', broadly the equivalent of counties. Polls suggest she could make it into the second-round run-off of a presidential election but is unlikely to win. Marine accused her father of committing 'political suicide' after he defended his past comment that Nazi gas chambers were a 'detail of history' last week . While other FN officials have been stripped of their party membership for racism, there has been no move to bar Jean-Marie Le Pen from a party of which he still holds the title of honorary president. He is popular with many FN members and will stand as a candidate in December's regional elections, despite having been convicted on numerous occasions of being anti-Jewish and for 'inciting racial hatred'. He has regularly made the comment about the Holocaust, telling the European Parliament in 2009: 'I just said that the gas chambers were a detail of Second World War history, which is clear.' Mr Le Pen was first convicted by a Munich court in 1999 for 'minimising the Holocaust' after telling a German far-right meeting that Nazi concentration camps and the gas chambers are 'what one calls a detail'. He has had a string of other convictions, including ones for violence and was briefly banned from being an MEP in 2003 following a physical attack on a French Socialist MEP. Jews have complained of increasing anti-Semitism in France, much of it stirred up by far-right activists. The Nazi Holocaust extended to France between 1940 and 1944, when thousands of Jews were entrained from cities like Paris to the German gas chambers.","highlights":"Marine Le Pen accused  father Jean-Marie of committing 'political suicide'\nComes after he\u00a0called France's Prime Minister Manuel Valls 'the immigrant'\nHe also defended comment that Nazi gas chambers were 'detail of history'\nLe Pen said she would oppose her father's bid to lead the National Front .","id":"f2deabb3292201abcb2bd78d01a2ec4f24c70ad5"}

'The only reason for us to get money in is to improve the infrastructure,' he told BBC London. 'There is no rush and we are in a good place. If it happens, it happens. We've done well enough that I think we can fund the player things we need to do out of our own resources. 'We are long overdue some ground improvements. They are very costly. We need to make sure we get that done. If that means bringing in other people, and they are the right people, then we'll do it.' Parish would, however, like investment in the club to carry out improvements at Selhurst Park . The CPFC2010 consortium took over with the Eagles having only just survived relegation from the Championship and, in under five years, have overseen a return to top-flight football. They finished last season in 11th place, ensuring for the first time that their stay in the Premier League would last longer than a solitary campaign. Pardew has guided them to the same position after being appointed at the turn of the year and Monday night's victory over City all-but guarantees a third Premier League season. Glenn Murray and Jason Puncheon had put Palace two goals up against the visitors, who could only find a consolation goal through Yaya Toure. Puncheon applauds the Manchester City supporters after a missile was thrown from the stands . Puncheon was also the target of a number of items thrown onto the pitch from the area housing Man City's supporters as he prepared to take a second-half corner. The Football Association are aware of the incident and will take appropriate action once they have their findings. It is not the first case of items being thrown onto the pitch at Selhurst Park this season, with Newcastle defender Fabricio Coloccini struck by a coin thrown as he celebrated a goal for his side. Just days later another item was thrown onto the playing area in the FA Cup meeting with Liverpool and Palace threatened to ban for life anyone found guilty of such acts.","highlights":"Crystal Palace beat Manchester City 2-1 at Selhurst Park on Monday night .\nWin all but secured Palace's status in the Premier League for another year .\nChairman Steve Parish says the club have funds to improve the squad .\nBut he wants investment to carry out necessary stadium improvements .\nCLICK HERE for the latest Crystal Palace news .","id":"0bb813a9d6725b38d0f0df553bbadb2e69deb2da"}
{"article":"Claims by the country's biggest food bank network that it served a million hungry people in a year were exposed as false yesterday. After the Labour Party and Trades Union Congress seized on the figure, with shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves describing it as 'shocking', the Trussell Trust admitted in a climbdown that 'these are not all unique users'. It emerged last night that its true number of users is likely to be no more than half a million \u2013 and possibly lower still. Scroll down for video . It emerged last night that the true number of food bank users is likely to be no more than half a million. File image used . The claim was widely reported by newspapers, while the BBC ran a headline on its website stating: 'Food banks used by \"more than one million people\".' But the Corporation also retreated yesterday, toning down its coverage as the one million figure unravelled. In the announcement of its food bank users, the Trussell Trust \u2013 which has 445 food banks run in its name \u2013 declared that 'more than one million people received three days' food'. However the Trust has now acknowledged that the claim was based on the number of food parcels given out, and not the number of individuals asking for help. It admitted that fewer than half its claimants come forward only once, and 15 per cent make more than three visits to a food bank in a year. It said that the average claimant uses two of the vouchers that entitle them to a food parcel in a year. The Trust, a charity which has expanded rapidly in recent years and which aspires to run a food bank in every town, found itself under fire from Tories over its claims. Claims by The Trussell Trust that it served a million hungry people in a year were exposed as false yesterday . Charlie Elphicke, the Conservative candidate for Dover and Deal, said: 'Their use of unverified figures is irresponsible and borders on scaremongering. Food bank usage is a serious issue \u2013 not something that should be used and misused for PR purposes. What the Trussell Trust would do better to highlight is that the best route out of poverty is to get a good job that gives you a regular pay packet.' One fact-checking think-tank, Full Fact, said last night: 'The claim that over a million people are using Trussell Trust food banks is inaccurate. 'It comes from confusing the number of different people using Trussell Trust food banks in a year with the number of times they use the food banks.' Full Fact said that even Trussell Trust's figures for the number of food parcels handed out \u2013 from 913,138 in the 2013\/14 financial year to 1,084,604 in the financial year which ended in March \u2013 did not mean that demand for free food was going up. It said the increase may reflect that more people are becoming aware of food banks, or people who were already in need have taken advantage of the opening of a new food bank in their neighbourhood. Trussell Trust chairman Chris Mould said: 'The number of times people were given three days of emergency food rose over a million during the year. 'Some of those people have eaten that food on more than one occasion during the year. We should not lose sight of the fact that a large and increasing number of people have been referred to food banks.' Mr Mould added that the charity would review the way its publishes its figures in future.","highlights":"The Trussell Trust admits that the one million were not all 'unique users'\nIt had previously claimed that it served a million hungry people in a year .\nLabour Party and Trades Union Congress were quick to seize on the figure .\nTrust has said the figure was based on the number of parcels handed out .","id":"edfcc325ff0f5910a849f216a90bb1a523d741d0"}
